# gibberish_computer_generated

# DESCRIPTION
A collection of various forms of gibberish and/or invented words etc. created by computer programs and human editing where needed. Also some shell scripts to e.g. prepare certain gibberish forms for web publication.

# USAGE
Peruse and enjoy. If you are in a habit of charitable giving and service, and you have time to burn and/or you're hopelessly bored, please feel free to clone this repository, edit some raw output to make more "sense," and do a pull request. If you aren't in the habit of doing charitable things, please consider any of so many far more worthy causes that need your attention. This is the kind of thing for which people may think "you have too much time on your hands," and they may be right.
