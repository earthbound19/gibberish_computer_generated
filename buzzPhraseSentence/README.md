# THIS IS A HACK

This exploits the buzzword npm (node js) module to produce random techy slogan gibberish. See examples in ./2500techyBuzzphraseSentences.txt

I may expand this to be able to create elaborate randomized sentences with properly conjugated verbs etc.

## Usage

Install nodejs. Google it.

then, from a terminal opened in this $PATH, and with nodejs installed: execute these commands:

npm install

node buzzphraseSentence.js

See the comments in buzzphraseSentence.js for possible parameters.

To e.g. write 2,500 buzzphraseSentences to a file, run the command:

node buzzphraseSentence.js 2500 > wut.txt

## Notes

At this writing, other files in this directory are scraps for potential further work / patches.

Yes, I have a package.json file here, which you'd think would correlate with something at the nodejs npm repository, but no such thing is published. It may be yet.
