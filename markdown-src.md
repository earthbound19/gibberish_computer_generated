## Artist Statement

_ARTIST-STATEMENT-GOES-HERE_

### ~

Wait what? What did you just read?

I ask myself the same thing after I read a lot of real-life artist statements too similar to the above.

#### You Can Draw These From a Hat Because It's All Farce
It's okay. It's supposed to be farce. Exactly like too much similar writing about art is not--not intentionally anyway.

Folks have studied and named the fugly beast which is such writing. It is [International Art English](https://www.canopycanopycanopy.com/contents/international_art_english), or IAE.

#### Good and Bad Artist Statements
A good artist statement may be:

- Optional: if it is better that there is no statement, _please_ make none
- Clear and accessible
- Usefully informative or descriptive of the art in away that may not be obvious to the observer, but which improves their experience or appreciation of the work upon learning.

A bad artist statement probably:

- Lacks any of those qualities
- Is conceived for any of countless bad reasons which all artists should say no to 
- Perhaps at worst profanely anoints and separates The Opaqueonaut: in reality the artist turned fool, but too few people see the emperor's clothes

#### How This Works

This page randomly selects and serves pre-generated farcical artist statements, many of which were created with computer assistance; for example by statistical sentence recombobulation: training an AI on actual IAE, then having it gurgitate similar stuff.

The statements, being AI-generated, are by nature (and if human-created, by dedication) in the Public Domain.

This page doubles as an API. To get a plain-text statement without this explanation, call the page with any GET variable declared, like this: [http://earthbound.io/gibberish-artist-statements/index.php?gib=florf](http://earthbound.io/gibberish-artist-statements/index.php?gib=florf)
