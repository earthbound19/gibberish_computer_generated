# NOT EMPOSTERED
- You can YOKE the ox to the PLOW, but you CAN'T MAKE HIM MOO
- DON'T COUNT your HORSES before they NEIGH
- A HATCHED CHICK can't tell the TIME
- YOU CAN'T LEAD A MAN to the TRACKS if you tell him BEFOREHAND that you intend to TIE HIM UP and LET THE TRAIN RUN HIM OVER. So DON'T TELL HIM THAT before you LEAD HIM TO THE TRACKS AND TIE HIM UP and LET THE TRAIN RUN HIM OVER
- THE STREAM WON'T RUN UPHILL until you YELL AT IT

# EMPOSTERED
- Sumpin' I wrote once?
