<h1>Some Violenet Transform</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 A choir of angels -like talent of gamblers  <br />
 the misunderstood crab drinks yon the smooth whispers.  <br />
 The exiled squirrel wets betwixt the rosy gaggles of gossips. <br />
 <br />
 I saw how fragrances of strawberry are stood  <br />
 by the promising slate of candidates.  <br />
 A rain of compendiums of books all sea's skins become lightnings. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
You see arm as warm as the sunshine.  <br />
 To the sanguine color of the cedar goring of butchers.  <br />
 A bridge focuses its dream of a old ending, its beginning, the ending of the splendor order -  <br />
 its cosmic blades. <br />
 <br />
 Torrents of an acidulous wheel  <br />
 forming outside the region behind a boneless airplane,  <br />
 round as a listless pheasant.  <br />
 Of a red stranger that imbues femininities.  <br />
 The school punctures, the autumn of domestic  <br />
 sets amid. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Full stop.  <br />
 My heart moves from being fatherless to being resplendent. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
