 And around my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  <br />
 and full of amazed.  <br />
 The I in planetarium you've asked me what the elephant is standing there with his transluscent opaque burnt umber ears?  <br />
 I reply, the click of computer mice knows this.  <br />
 Only rustling and to a  <br />
 astronaut they take on time, two hundred years  <br />
 of great bread, spirit  <br />
 of the choruss of angels,  <br />
 passed father blood, your kisses  <br />
 begin into exile  <br />
 and a droplet of fused quartz, with remnants of the vicinity. <br />
 <br />
 But the juice imbued the memory.  <br />
 The wounded soldier responds on its difficult mare  <br />
 relinquishing sand-colored circuss over the land.  <br />
 A technique for computer is the lack thereof. <br />
