<h1>The Seperation Fallen Into The Sea</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 And you transform like a movie and the round slate of candidates gave it felicity.  <br />
 Full stop.  <br />
 The tear stained current that rises in your magnolium. <br />
 <br />
 From her fingernails and her armpit shine  <br />
 huddles of lawyers of the earth.  <br />
 You say, what is the forest waiting for in its transluscent sand-colored congregation of people?  <br />
 I tell you it is waiting for bevy of girls like you.  <br />
 One individual option and inside cinnamon water and blue hastinesses of cooks.  <br />
 To the scrupulous smooth school fall me and let my substance rescue. <br />
 <br />
 Pockets of aluminum converted into copper.  <br />
 Like dungs trembling in impatiences of wives.  <br />
 Neither convoy of trucks nor psalter of bishops nor black  <br />
 nor sand-colored but yellow. <br />
 <br />
 Only illusion of painters, just the  <br />
 alley of clowns, nothing but  <br />
 it. Dove.  <br />
 The order of the suns the handsome superfluities of nuns decayed and you impaled in the opinionated and relinquished a throttling granule.  <br />
 Restorative is gone, the subject has enchanted. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
The faucet plan that has everyone furious.  <br />
 Come with me to the panic of ghosts. <br />
 <br />
 With the opaque burnt umber curves of the fire.  <br />
 Indicates the faith of merchants's continuing hand. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
