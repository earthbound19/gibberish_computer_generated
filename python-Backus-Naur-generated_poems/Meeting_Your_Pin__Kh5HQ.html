<h1>Meeting Your Pin</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Door.  <br />
 Around the land I like to pacify like a dry land.  <br />
 Outside  <br />
 the turqoise infuriated of the stick.  <br />
 Performing a obeisance of servants  <br />
 transformed in the human fog. <br />
 <br />
 I took on boney condescencions of actors.  <br />
 Come with me to the unction of undertakers of pities of prisoners.  <br />
 I perform as if behind a cold stick.  <br />
 As if to petrify or perfume or reject. <br />
 <br />
 I could upgrade ego, enemy, and twisting lonely road  <br />
 from pads of paper and warmths  <br />
 with a turqoise wreath  <br />
 with hearts in my loins. <br />
