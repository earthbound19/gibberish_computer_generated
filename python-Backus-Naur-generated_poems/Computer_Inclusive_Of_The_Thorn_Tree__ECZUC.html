 One of them is aquatic,  <br />
 the other knows inscriptions.  <br />
 Where is someone  <br />
 he squeaks, and when can we see what  <br />
 is going to happen?  <br />
 A eager sun of gardens.  <br />
 I wish to make a line  <br />
 within, and every sight, many  <br />
 times hidden in a sea's skin. <br />
 <br />
 Chaotic morning and the clenched wave  <br />
 die at the walls of my house.  <br />
 When the divisions is full of shady shoulder  <br />
 within gates and rabid burned-out cathedrals  <br />
 and the inaccessible sweetness and the bevies of beauties  <br />
 at last give forth their imperalist cold fire.  <br />
 And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  <br />
 expand of circuss and clusters of things  <br />
 and the charitable planetariums of his native land?  <br />
 What throttles the props of wary? <br />
 <br />
 Perching from barbaous glass.  <br />
 And in my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  <br />
 and full of calm.  <br />
 Sometimes a piece of the phosphor  <br />
 undulates like a jar in my  <br />
 ears. <br />
 <br />
 Someone here is waiting for the next huddle of lawyers.  <br />
 Troupe of dancers. You trusted yourself for flowing.  <br />
 What epiphany does the lobster contain?  <br />
 How little we swim and how much it swims the curiosities of this universe.  <br />
 Weak daughters and aunts.  <br />
 For me they are technical.  <br />
 I understand as if with a insufferable lonely road.  <br />
 What we say kisses to  <br />
 swim some other uncle  <br />
 what a phenomenon may teach. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Next to transluscent burnt umber water and transparent bells.  <br />
 The reasons for my respect  <br />
 are shone in my arm of cork. <br />
 <br />
 And so that its rectums will plague your toe. <br />
