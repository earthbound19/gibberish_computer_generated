<h1>Meeting Your Shards Of Paper-mache</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Next to the filtering  <br />
 convicts.  <br />
 In the face of so many martyrs to animosity. <br />
 <br />
 And phalanxes of umbrellas and souls.  <br />
 A clenched thread day  <br />
 of a dull shades of crimson man that builds condescencions of actors.  <br />
 Not the crimson moment  <br />
 when the day treads the anthologies of poems.  <br />
 What passes the props of doubt? <br />
 <br />
 <br />
A company of actors chirping will perch  <br />
 the rambunctious obsidian of a planet. <br />
