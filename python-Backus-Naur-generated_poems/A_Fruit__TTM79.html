<h1>A Fruit</h1>

<p>
 To the decisive smooth salt all salts become oxides.  <br />
 Because I love you, love, within the silt and in front of the jade.  <br />
 You - the starry tail.  <br />
 In your chest of degrading the jungle begins to dream of understanding. <br />
 <br />
 Because I love you, love, behind the lava and inside the ice.  <br />
 An odor has lived about the propeller,  <br />
 a mixture of coffin and body, a continuing  <br />
 goblet that brings frustration. <br />
 <br />
 The day starry skies you in its mortal plasma. <br />
