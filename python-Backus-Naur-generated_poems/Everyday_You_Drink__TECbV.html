<p>
 And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  <br />
 relax of giggles of girls and armadas of ships  <br />
 and the moonlit echoes of his native land? <br />
 <br />
 Attract on the dens of thieves that wait for you  <br />
 soddening the obscene chairs, abandoning the doors. <br />
 <br />
 What trembles the props of inspiration?  <br />
 Be guided by the lovely foliage's productivity.  <br />
 I am fell by bridge and imbroglio, by panic and drizzle.  <br />
 Where alcoves meet  <br />
 branches meet, amid and next to and the sound  <br />
 of trashes, to reach out and mingle in ignorant. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Yellow plasma to my tear stained time!  <br />
 Your breath reflects from east  <br />
 to north <br />
 <br />
