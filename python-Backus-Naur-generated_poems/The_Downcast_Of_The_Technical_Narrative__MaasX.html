<h1>The Downcast Of The Technical Narrative</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 My heart is filled with impolite like a glass thread.  <br />
 Gallop on the cold fires that wait for you  <br />
 striking the demonic chairs, coddling the doors.  <br />
 Conversations of parliaments of beggars, the recitation  <br />
 of platoons of soldiers we call careful serendipity. <br />
