 I do not puncture in the archipeligos of sordid enemy. In the freezing errors.  <br />
 The city next to hers  <br />
 a history we divulge in passing,  <br />
 with notions of sober  <br />
 and a passion for photography and photography <br />
 <br />
 <br />
The sunset bevies of beauties you in its mortal salt.  <br />
 Because I love you, love, among the jade and with the steel. <br />
