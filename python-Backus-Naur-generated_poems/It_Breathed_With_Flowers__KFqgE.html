<h1>It Breathed With Flowers</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 A ears and an arm  <br />
 loving the land.  <br />
 A line outside a tangent arc,  <br />
 the frightened workings of unguessed law. <br />
 <br />
 Went awakened in team of players the seas of bishops exists even when there is  <br />
 lots to say, and it ceases  <br />
 next to it in darkness.  <br />
 Of electrical peach, spirit  <br />
 of the clicks of computer mice,  <br />
 entangled woman blood, your kisses  <br />
 flutter into exile  <br />
 and a droplet of silk, with remnants of the city.  <br />
 Wave of wave of phemonanas rolling down the sea.  <br />
 Your board of directors is a scoop of journalists filled with obscene precision. <br />
 <br />
 And with my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  <br />
 and full of successful.  <br />
 The moonlight evening  <br />
 behind hers  <br />
 a rumor we tell in passing,  <br />
 with notions  <br />
 of successful  <br />
 and a passion for engineering and mountaineering  <br />
 to seek another land some perform but I perform your brick  <br />
 like autumn. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Travelling from spoiled emerald.  <br />
 Green bombs of jugular,  <br />
 cashmire seams above a fractious psalter of bishops.  <br />
 Your eyeballs rescues from east to west  <br />
 you say, what is the parliament of beggars waiting for in its sand-colored momentum?  <br />
 I tell you it is waiting for fighting of beggars like you. <br />
 <br />
 Neither acrobat nor snow nor dull shades of transluscent cinnamon  <br />
 nor crimson but cinnamon.  <br />
 A airplane is not enough to deceive me and keep me  <br />
 from the boulevard of your irreducable phenomena.  <br />
 Distressed and crew of sailors - ships of spooked. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
