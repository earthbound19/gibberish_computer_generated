<h1>The Muzzled Daughter</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 The jungle around hers  <br />
 a history we tell in passing,  <br />
 with notions of joy  <br />
 and a passion for science and computer science halfway.  <br />
 Transluscent sepia nails of gate,  <br />
 sand-colored seams above a clotting pasture.  <br />
 Pulled out and closed off like a damning of jurors. <br />
 <br />
 A bicycle is not enough to forebode me and keep me  <br />
 from the night of your stationary curiosities.  <br />
 What cracks the props of cheery?  <br />
 Around  <br />
 the lunging conglomerates.  <br />
 We get the color  <br />
 they must lots to enrich  <br />
 to each other  <br />
 or perhaps nothing but cold fires.  <br />
 Perhaps they are not dropped. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
We open  <br />
 the halves of a phenomena and the  <br />
 trembling of blades hears into the warm room.  <br />
 Inside opaque crimson water and sepia anthologies of poems. <br />
 <br />
 Sepia ice to my phosphorus change of bells! <br />
 <br />
 Storing from ironous emerald.  <br />
 She is betwixt us at this moment of first dawning.  <br />
 The jackal gathers on its shady mare  <br />
 preserving transparent pads of paper over the city. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Burnt umber gypsum to my fatherless angel!  <br />
 But I should be inexorably linked to jouranlism, congealing among its chaotic bird feathers  <br />
 so let us aspire to to tell a story without historical redundancies. <br />
 <br />
