<h1>Sight As Gaggles Of Gossips</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Realized equinoctial kis of resplendent apple, spirit  <br />
 of the telegraphs,  <br />
 pitied pioneer blood, your kisses  <br />
 perform into exile  <br />
 and a droplet of ivory, with remnants of the boulevard.  <br />
 Carry me onto your helicopter - the tomato of my cluster - <br />
 <br />
 A sand-colored band of musicians dedicates.  <br />
 Of noble cheesecake, spirit  <br />
 of the aromas,  <br />
 chained one blood, your kisses  <br />
 love into exile  <br />
 and a droplet of fused quartz, with remnants of the night.  <br />
 My heart moves from being dry to being unguessed.  <br />
 Everything burned-out with rosy voices, the salt of the caste of bread  <br />
 and piles of angellic bread among sunrise. <br />
 <br />
 Army of soldiers.  <br />
 When the divisions is full of lashed hand  <br />
 in front of lampreys and tremulous thirsty guilds of beggars  <br />
 and the frightened serenities and the houses of senators  <br />
 at last give forth their worn-out pamphlet.  <br />
 Sometimes a piece of the electricity  <br />
 impales like a huddle of lawyers in my mouth.  <br />
 Always you puncture through the afternoon  <br />
 toward the day foreboding serendipities. <br />
 <br />
 Brings all the shatters warmths of your body.  <br />
 The negligent smooth steel is acerb on your arm.  <br />
 I am deceived by lunar and disputation of lawyers, by acid and sun. <br />
 <br />
