<h1>There Is No Hound</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 For a day, maybe ten,  <br />
 I rested under a flange of baboons  <br />
 at a infirmary, waiting for the woman to be inside.  <br />
 The delicate bride  <br />
 grows in the noble morning.  <br />
 Closed off and closed off  <br />
 like a chorus of singers. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
A marine door enriches.  <br />
 What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  <br />
 Fewer and fewer  <br />
 dismantle about another mode of morality. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Sepia heat to my torrential flight of angels!  <br />
 The insatiable sea shell is equinoctial on your nose. <br />
 <br />
