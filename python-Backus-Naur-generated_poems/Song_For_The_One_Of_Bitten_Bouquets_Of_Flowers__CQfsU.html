<h1>Song For The One Of Bitten Bouquets Of Flowers</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Only brutal and to a  <br />
 man they take on time, thirteed years the phosphor acerb dungs are abandoned.  <br />
 Draw from it the inaccessible  <br />
 identity of its own phenomenon. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
A friendly rug making a electric thing of a chance meeting with a uncle.  <br />
 A quadrangle with a circle,  <br />
 the inevitable workings of poetic law.  <br />
 Full stop. <br />
 <br />
 And so that its violas will shake your breath.  <br />
 I salute your handsome nectarine  <br />
 and envy your esoteric pride.  <br />
 Where snows meet  <br />
 souls meet, next to and among and the sound  <br />
 of lances, to reach out and kiss in neglected. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
We get the faith  <br />
 they must lots to swim  <br />
 to each other  <br />
 or perhaps nothing but malapertnesses of pedlars.  <br />
 Perhaps they are not wiped.  <br />
 Shall we proceed? <br />
 <br />
 <br />
