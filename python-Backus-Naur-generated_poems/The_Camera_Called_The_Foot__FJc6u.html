<h1>The Camera Called The Foot</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 The miracle knows this,  <br />
 that life in it's gold boxes is as endless as the praise.  <br />
 The farm plan that has everyone furious.  <br />
 Has the archipeligos been flew with epiphany? <br />
 <br />
 Outside the doctrine of doctors of the region where you sleep,  <br />
 a dream undulates into computers.  <br />
 Like moldy bananas deceiving inside farms.  <br />
 The bloodied brush transforms on its insatiable mare  <br />
 reconciling sepia  <br />
 piles of books over the vicinity.  <br />
 I salute your noble lemon  <br />
 and envy your hidden pride. <br />
 <br />
 Woeful and faucet - guitars of churlish. The ancient dignity of the poppy!  <br />
 And an absurd smooth ash's ice will rescue you.  <br />
 A boundless snow of femininities. <br />
 <br />
 The sailor smiles at the bride  <br />
 but the one does not smile  <br />
 when he looks at the crab mother  <br />
 and the shifty ocean.  <br />
 As if to conquer or inherit or abandon.  <br />
 But I should be betrays the nature of mountaineering, executing among its fire-tipped scoldings of seamstresses  <br />
 so let us begin to speak a story devoid of alphabetic redundancies.  <br />
 Carry me onto your raft - the lemon of my trouser -  <br />
 and you ignored in the unworthy and recovered a gnawing night. <br />
 <br />
 You are the tomato of my distorted chest.  <br />
 I am  <br />
 conquered by compendium of books and whisper, by vagabond and sunshine.  <br />
 To the essential color of the ceramic lake. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
My incredulous pimple relinquishes you always.  <br />
 I wish to make a tetrahedron  <br />
 among, and every color, many  <br />
 times hidden in a goblet. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
