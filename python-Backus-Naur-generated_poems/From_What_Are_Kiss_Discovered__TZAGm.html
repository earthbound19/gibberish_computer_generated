 What we say connects to  <br />
 chirp some other astronaut  <br />
 what a sequence may teach. Carry me onto your helicopter - the grape of my leaf - like the fatherless graphite of keys what unguessed grapes -  <br />
 the vicinity is filled with it,  <br />
 trysts for the coster of beggars and the calcerous glass.  <br />
 My heart is filled with wary like a silicon path. <br />
