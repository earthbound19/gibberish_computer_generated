<h1>Meeting Your Rooster</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Like the morbid brick of casts of actors and so that its eternities will filter your lip.  <br />
 A friendly rug making a warm thing of a impossible meeting with a gentleman. <br />
 <br />
 Always you attack through the late afternoon  <br />
 toward the midnight decaying armadas of ships.  <br />
 Like pities of prisoners puncturing around wreaths.  <br />
 Around the field I like to connect like a cheerless superfluity of nuns.  <br />
 Sometimes a piece of the water  <br />
 gnaws like a shuffle of bureaucrats in my breath. <br />
 <br />
 Like hollow horse, lands  <br />
 disintered twilight and the shady quilt  <br />
 gnaw at the walls of my house.  <br />
 Realized trusting bale of wool the quiver of arrows chirps  <br />
 in flying your hips.  <br />
 Behind transparent water and marine affections. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
A snow focuses its dream of a new ending, its beginning, the ever pausing of the foliage order -  <br />
 its romantic wastelands.  <br />
 Behind the red unsavory of the acid.  <br />
 From her armpit and her ears enchant  <br />
 troupes of dancers of the earth.  <br />
 When the university is full of clotting loins  <br />
 among flames and harsh tear stained films  <br />
 and the rustling muscles and the trees  <br />
 at last give forth their callous rooster. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
