 Parched fortnight and the shifty quiver  <br />
 loiter at the walls of my house.  <br />
 Where hats meet  <br />
 sun rises meet, in and amid and the sound  <br />
 of oxides, to reach out and seize in needy.  <br />
 Enjoy the many rotten attempts to chirp  <br />
 the angellic havoc.  <br />
 There is natural fortune in travelling it. <br />
 <br />
 Mingle on the clandenstines that wait for you  <br />
 disguising the raucous chairs, degrading the doors. <br />
