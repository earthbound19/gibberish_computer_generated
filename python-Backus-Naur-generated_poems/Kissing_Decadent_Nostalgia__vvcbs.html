<h1>Kissing Decadent Nostalgia</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 And meetings of blood-stained arm next to the faltering stenches.  <br />
 Behind the rustling university of inevitable scoop of journalists. <br />
 <br />
 In the first scene, the verdure fisherman  <br />
 is devoured by a elder. In the second  <br />
 take he returns, to shine and to crystallize.  <br />
 The congregation of people steals, the bell of slender  <br />
 mixes within.  <br />
 Has the night been rustled with mysteries? <br />
 <br />
 I wish to make a quadrangle  <br />
 around, and every color, many  <br />
 times hidden in a smooth stone.  <br />
 You are the brutal stranger of a toucan,  <br />
 the inaccessible ness of the reflection, the power of the wind.  <br />
 I took on calculating candles.  <br />
 A line amid a loop,  <br />
 the fractious workings of cordial law. <br />
 <br />
 From bike of ants to rout of snails,  <br />
 hidden flights of angels drawn by round channels, a  <br />
 hushed serendipity begins to develop.  <br />
 You are the rigid daughter of a crab,  <br />
 the absurd ness of the circus, the power of the ore.  <br />
 I saw how maps are developed  <br />
 by the absorbant baptism of fire.  <br />
 Someone here is waiting for the next praise.  <br />
 Bench of bishops. You upgraded yourself for relinquishing. <br />
 <br />
