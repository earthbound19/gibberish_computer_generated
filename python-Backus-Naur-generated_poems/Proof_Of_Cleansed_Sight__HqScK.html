<h1>Proof Of Cleansed Sight</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 If you were not the apple the eloquent moon  <br />
 cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the region.  <br />
 What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another. <br />
 <br />
 What we say refreshes to  <br />
 preserve some other son  <br />
 what a detail may teach.  <br />
 What bristles the props of bold? <br />
 <br />
 <br />
The absorbant dignity of the time!  <br />
 And so that its deaths will congeal your shoulder. <br />
