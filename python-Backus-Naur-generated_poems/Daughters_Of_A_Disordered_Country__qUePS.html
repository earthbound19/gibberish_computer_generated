<h1>Daughters Of A Disordered Country</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 A helicopter is not enough to scratch me and keep me  <br />
 from the modern office of your plumed secrets.  <br />
 Like the bitterest brick of serenities  <br />
 rejoice on the shardss of cedar that wait for you  <br />
 forcing the absurd chairs, abhorring the doors. <br />
 <br />
 Like invasions wiping amid tigers.  <br />
 In your ears of twisting the night begins to dream of responding. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Expanding a pack of cards  <br />
 galloped in the real sunshine. <br />
