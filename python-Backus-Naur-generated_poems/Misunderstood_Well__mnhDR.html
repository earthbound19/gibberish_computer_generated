<h1>Misunderstood Well</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 I'd do it for the wheatfield in which you wake  <br />
 for the roses of deep brown you've loved.  <br />
 What arcane bridges -  <br />
 the modern office is filled with it,  <br />
 alcoves for the wreath and the windy chalk. <br />
 <br />
 In your breath of overflowing the heights begins to dream of recovering.  <br />
 Promise of bartenders of an abolished rambunctious fragrance of strawberry.  <br />
 A ultraviolet and ironous phalanx of umbrellas is gnawn in the field. <br />
 <br />
 Always you chain through the fortnight  <br />
 toward the afternoon erupting armies of soldiers.  <br />
 In the smallest cedar parliament of beggars I salute your secure plum  <br />
 and envy your verdure pride.  <br />
 The dust imposes nessecity.  <br />
 Nothing but that escheat of lawyers of troupes of dancers. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
My heart moves from being demonic to being winged.  <br />
 Of smooth wine, spirit  <br />
 of the silences,  <br />
 gnawn lady blood, your kisses  <br />
 trust into exile  <br />
 and a droplet of crystal, with remnants of the vicinity. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
