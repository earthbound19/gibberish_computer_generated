<h1>Every Goddess Is A Inscription</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Because I love you, love, in front of the earth and in front of the wind.  <br />
 I'd do it for the choir of singers in which you flow  <br />
 for the tigers of burnt umber you've magnified.  <br />
 In the face of so  <br />
 many serections to animosity.  <br />
 Shall we go forward? <br />
 <br />
 In my thicket at holiday you are like a sun  <br />
 and your form and colour the way I gather them.  <br />
 The coral plan that has everyone wounded. <br />
 <br />
 You are the banana of my clotting eyes.  <br />
 Queasy and pile of books - smooth salts of antagonistic. <br />
