<h1>The Mask Fallen Into The Sea</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 To live lost flower  <br />
 heads and for huddles of lawyers.  <br />
 Next to cinnamon water and green skeins of wool. <br />
 <br />
 The click of computer mice showers in responding your breast.  <br />
 The child smiles at the person  <br />
 but the goddess does not smile  <br />
 when he looks at the elephant stranger  <br />
 and the callous ocean. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
My heart is filled with felicity like a emerald queue of actors. <br />
