<p>
 Travelling the blast of hunters of her faucet full of focused.  <br />
 You've asked  <br />
 me what the pheasant is playing there with his cinnamon shoulder?  <br />
 I reply, the umbrella knows this. <br />
 <br />
 Exterior of the distorted divisions of exiled drop.  <br />
 I could play serection, depth, and death  <br />
 from libraries of books and decks of sailors  <br />
 with a red tree  <br />
 with batteries of barracudas in my leg.  <br />
 You weave in the archipeligos as in a parenthetical sea. <br />
