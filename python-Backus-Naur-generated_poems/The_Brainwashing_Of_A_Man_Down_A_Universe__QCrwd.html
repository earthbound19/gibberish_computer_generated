<h1>The Brainwashing Of A Man Down A Universe</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Indicates the flight of angels's conducting eyelids. Towards those blasts of hunters of yours that wait for me.  <br />
 Not the yellow moment  <br />
 when the night rises the brigades of soldiers. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Enjoy the many dead attempts to re-cover  <br />
 the fluidic rooster.  <br />
 There is absorbant fortune in crystallizing it.  <br />
 I'd do it for the sea's skin in which you imbue  <br />
 for the necklaces of deep  <br />
 brown you've recovered.  <br />
 One of them is electric,  <br />
 the other  <br />
 knows projections.  <br />
 Where is no one  <br />
 she utters, and when can we see what  <br />
 is going to happen? <br />
 <br />
 In your lip of scratching the heights begins to dream of seeking.  <br />
 The hairy galaxy of beauties that awakens in your souffle of clouds.  <br />
 It was a harsh business of lightning and coals.  <br />
 This sordid bevy of girls and drinking bale of wool undulates me  <br />
 with it's infinite planetariums like fingernails and eye  <br />
 and blood colored illusions of magicians like hips and castes of bread. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
