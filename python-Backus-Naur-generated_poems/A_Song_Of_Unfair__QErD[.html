<h1>A Song Of Unfair</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Pure seperation drinks the parliaments of beggars waxes of a weak raft  <br />
 travelling inside the night around a mechanical bicycle,  <br />
 absorbant as a chaotic cat. If you were not the lemon the electrical moon  <br />
 cooks, sprinkling its bread across the modern office.  <br />
 Around the burnt umber fingernails of the clay.  <br />
 My heart moves from being dead to being changeless.  <br />
 To the cosmic angellic garden disintered lampreys and demonic vagabonds. <br />
 <br />
 I am fell by fountain and torrent, by consequence and snow.  <br />
 As soon as the incoming bevies of girls  <br />
 gives the minor indication.  <br />
 Sometimes a piece of the water  <br />
 disguises like a scolding of seamstresses in my eyes. <br />
 <br />
 The serenity knows this,  <br />
 that life in it's cork boxes is as endless as the bevy of ladies.  <br />
 I salute your friendly bread  <br />
 and envy your delicious pride.  <br />
 And a brutal laminated sign's electricity will promise you.  <br />
 Sticky sons and aunts.  <br />
 For me they are neutral. <br />
 <br />
 For company of soldiers was listless and morally neutral.  <br />
 Everyone here is waiting for the next current.  <br />
 Rose. You pacified yourself for living.  <br />
 You are the cherry of my hated tail. <br />
 <br />
