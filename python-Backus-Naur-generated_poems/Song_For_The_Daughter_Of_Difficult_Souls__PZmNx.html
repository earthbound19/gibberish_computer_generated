<h1>Song For The Daughter Of Difficult Souls</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 You, who is like a bramble tiger among the drinking of many mother.  <br />
 The fortnight fragrances of strawberry you in its mortal water.  <br />
 I wish to make a square  <br />
 inside, and every sight, many  <br />
 times hidden in a team of players.  <br />
 Only drop, just the  <br />
 law, nothing but  <br />
 it. Branch. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
