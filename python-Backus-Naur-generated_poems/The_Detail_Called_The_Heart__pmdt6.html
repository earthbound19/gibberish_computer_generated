<h1>The Detail Called The Heart</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Only cold and to a  <br />
 astronaut they take on time, million years  <br />
 I want you to chirp on my chest.  <br />
 Magnifying toward the chorus of angels a calculation trusts,  <br />
 pampers - it does not return.  <br />
 But the branch formed the memory. <br />
 <br />
 And outside my hammock, during the sunset, I woke up naked  <br />
 and full of terrific.  <br />
 They dismantled it with motionless promises.  <br />
 I'm the stranger to the perfume of immediate femininity. <br />
 <br />
