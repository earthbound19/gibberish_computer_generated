<h1>The Image Of Minor Points</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 On what dilute oblivions chirped with silica?  <br />
 I saw  <br />
 how elixirs are enriched  <br />
 by the hidden moon.  <br />
 Carry me onto your boat - the cherry of my law - <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Relax on the incantations of witches that wait for you  <br />
 deceiving the fire-tipped chairs, conquering the doors.  <br />
 Of your opaque dull shades of transparent affection when you hold out your heart.  <br />
 I do not silence in the room of tremulous felicity. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
A moon reconciling will rejoice  <br />
 the frightened copper of a planet.  <br />
 Shall we recount? <br />
 <br />
 My trusting heart flutters you always.  <br />
 A muster of soldiers -like abberation  <br />
 he is beyond us at this moment of first pulsing. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
The equinoctial damning of jurors gave  <br />
 it humor.  <br />
 We open the halves of a curiosities and the  <br />
 rejecting of wombs circumscribes into the thick vicinity. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
