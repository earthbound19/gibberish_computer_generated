<h1>Rejoicing Boneless Nostalgia</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 In your foot of surly the universe  <br />
 of forms gather. Next to sepia water and sand-colored affections. Not the sunburst orange moment  <br />
 when the fortnight dawns the magnoliums.  <br />
 Lake was no longer  <br />
 right at the log threshold.  <br />
 A transluscent silvery giggle of girls flies.  <br />
 The cummerbund carries on its parched mare  <br />
 enchanting crimson fightings of beggars over the jungle. <br />
