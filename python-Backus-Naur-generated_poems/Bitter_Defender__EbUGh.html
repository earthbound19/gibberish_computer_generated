<h1>Bitter Defender</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Because I love you, love, among the ore and amid the gypsum.  <br />
 Realized infinite love on what calcerous roosters shone with tin? <br />
 <br />
 The demonic turkey pulses afar from the pure flames.  <br />
 Of cosmic plum, spirit  <br />
 of the hosts of angels,  <br />
 harassed giant blood, your kisses  <br />
 flow into exile  <br />
 and a droplet of silk, with remnants of the heights. <br />
 <br />
 An odor has chirped surpassing the splendor,  <br />
 a mixture of wax and body, a growing  <br />
 illusion of painters that brings ill-tempered. <br />
