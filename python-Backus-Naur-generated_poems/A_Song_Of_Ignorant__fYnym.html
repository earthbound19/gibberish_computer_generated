<h1>A Song Of Ignorant</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 I took on calculating brigades of soldiers. Shake me and let my substance continue.  <br />
 And the muster of soldiers to its quilt  <br />
 and among the choruss of singers the esoteric one  <br />
 the cousin covered with serendipidous foam. <br />
 <br />
 I do not deceive in the city of lonely darknes.  <br />
 I wish to make a triangle  <br />
 outside, and  <br />
 every sense, many  <br />
 times hidden in a warmth. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
