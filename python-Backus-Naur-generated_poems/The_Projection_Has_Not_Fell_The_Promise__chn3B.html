<h1>The Projection Has Not Fell The Promise</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 A wheel is not enough to mourn me and keep me  <br />
 from the archipeligos of your self-assured mysteries.  <br />
 What wets the props of exhilaration? <br />
 <br />
 In the gaggle of women of the university where you sleep,  <br />
 a dream executes into computers.  <br />
 My sweet-smelling eyes grows you always. <br />
 <br />
 What unguessed sea shells -  <br />
 the field is filled with it,  <br />
 boards of directors for the fountain and the ironous emerald.  <br />
 You, who is like a trap oyster among the expanding of many elder.  <br />
 Flying toward the pasture return to the homeland  <br />
 of the prizes. <br />
 <br />
 Leaf was no longer below the recording threshold.  <br />
 Conversations of lakes, the recitation  <br />
 of illusions of magicians we call winged home.  <br />
 To awaken lost fountains and for huddles of houses.  <br />
 Extinctions of a mechanical wheel  <br />
 weaving in front of the modern office among a pale vessel, <br />
 <br />
 Sensible as a mourning jaguar. <br />
 <br />
