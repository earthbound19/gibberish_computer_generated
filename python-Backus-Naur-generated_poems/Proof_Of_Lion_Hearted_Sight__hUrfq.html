 And landscapes and planetariums.  <br />
 Wheatfield. <br />
 <br />
 I want you to expand on my hips.  <br />
 Once there was a silent elder who  <br />
 rejoiced at parties, sitting in a bezier, among bales of wool.  <br />
 Come with me to the ego of consequences.  <br />
 A loaf of bread baked with guilt delighted and salt.  <br />
 The bottle crushes, the tiger of sensible  <br />
 pulses within. <br />
 <br />
 Realized verdure peace exuberant is gone, the subject has relaxed.  <br />
 Comfortable empire. The loop functions to fashion a context  <br />
 to its architecture.  <br />
 An odor has preserved among the flotilla of ships,  <br />
 a mixture of stalactite and body, a storing  <br />
 condescencion of actors that brings sickly. <br />
