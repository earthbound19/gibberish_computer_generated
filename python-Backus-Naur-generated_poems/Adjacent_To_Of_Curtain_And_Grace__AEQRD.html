 You are the insufferable father of a squirrel,  <br />
 the troubled ness of the circus, the power of the ore. <br />
 <br />
 What we say forms to  <br />
 crystallize some other lady  <br />
 what a identity may teach. <br />
 <br />
 The enduring dignity  <br />
 of the convoy of trucks!  <br />
 Necklace.  <br />
 And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  <br />
 make of currents and quilts  <br />
 and the steady bevies of beauties of his native land?  <br />
 A chorus of toucans at fortnight un played un attacked  <br />
 comes to a halt before a muster of soldiers. <br />
 <br />
 You shower my weak mask  <br />
 like a indespensable squirrel to fresh orange.  <br />
 In the smearing vigils.  <br />
 Wave of wave of gaggles of women rolling down the sea. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
A lip and a eyeballs  <br />
 breathing the modern office.  <br />
 I took on disordered precisions.  <br />
 What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  <br />
 Sometimes a piece of the water  <br />
 smothers like a choir of singers in my toe. <br />
 <br />
