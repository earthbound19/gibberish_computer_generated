<h1>From Ice To Jade</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 I'd do it for the baptism of fire in which you entertain  <br />
 for the congregations of people of silvery you've pulsed. The squad of soldiers dawning from my lip.  <br />
 Went recovered in flower head carry me onto your car - the cherry of my drop -  <br />
 outside silvery water and burnt umber choirs of angels.  <br />
 I could pacify moldy banana, shadow, and legume  <br />
 from companies of actors and serenities  <br />
 with a rust colored sweetnes  <br />
 with waxes in my eye. <br />
 <br />
 Carry me onto your airplane - the tomato of my sweetnes -  <br />
 a friendly carpet  <br />
 making a hopeful thing of a lucky meeting with a pioneer.  <br />
 The holiday babbles of barbers you in its mortal  <br />
 tin. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Your warmth is a peace filled with sterile bird feather.  <br />
 Cold weather, silent lights like the wing of aircraft.  <br />
 And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  <br />
 reflect  <br />
 of manes and cries of players  <br />
 and the smooth spheres of his native land?  <br />
 For a day, maybe quadrillion,  <br />
 I rested under a troup of whales  <br />
 at a photography booth, waiting for the mountaineer to be within. <br />
