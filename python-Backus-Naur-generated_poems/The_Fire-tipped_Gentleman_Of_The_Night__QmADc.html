<h1>The Fire-tipped Gentleman Of The Night</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 He is perpendicular to us at this moment of first conducting.  <br />
 Father of the depths of my shoulder - your drinking  <br />
 stills your hidden regard as though it were iron.  <br />
 Wave of wave of armadas of ships rolling down the sea.  <br />
 My homogeneous loins dedicates you always. <br />
 <br />
 The torrential troupe of artists that entertains in your flint.  <br />
 In the first reel, the manly uncle  <br />
 is congealed by a pioneer. In the second  <br />
 take he returns, to conduct and to shine. <br />
 <br />
 What self-assured harmonies of singers -  <br />
 the modern office is filled with it,  <br />
 railroad tracks for the starry sky and the hated diamond.  <br />
 And behind my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up naked  <br />
 and  <br />
 full of morality. <br />
 <br />
