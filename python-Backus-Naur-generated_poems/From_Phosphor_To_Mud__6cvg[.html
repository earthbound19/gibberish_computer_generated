<h1>From Phosphor To Mud</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 In my field at sunrise you are like a kis  <br />
 and your form and colour the way I crystallize them.  <br />
 In your leg of sobbing the vicinity begins to dream of rescuing. <br />
 <br />
 Our new illusion of painters, our ancient home quadrangles.  <br />
 For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  <br />
 I rested under a unkindness of ravens  <br />
 at a bazzar, waiting for the daughter to be in  <br />
 front of. <br />
 <br />
