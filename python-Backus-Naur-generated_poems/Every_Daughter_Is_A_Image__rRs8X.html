<h1>Every Daughter Is A Image</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 What we say treads to  <br />
 shower some other person  <br />
 what a synonym may teach.  <br />
 Crimson hearts of oxide,  <br />
 sunburst orange seams above a rusted quiver.  <br />
 A droplet -like parallel shardss of paper-mache  <br />
 sometimes a piece of the wind  <br />
 devours like a foliage in my hips. <br />
 <br />
 Where gaggles of women meet  <br />
 stones meet, inside and around and the sound  <br />
 of twisting lonely roads, to reach out and pacify in fierce.  <br />
 Cold goddesses and mothers.  <br />
 For me they are individual.  <br />
 The scandalmongering trusts on its tenacious mare  <br />
 reconciling green landscapes over the vicinity.  <br />
 A vessel is not enough to sob me and keep me  <br />
 from the jungle of your parenthetical curiosities.  <br />
 Everybody here is  <br />
 waiting for the next ambush of widows.  <br />
 Cry of actors. You discovered yourself for setting. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
A current of lyrical home  <br />
 that does not know why it flows and pacifies.  <br />
 What mysteries does the turkey contain?  <br />
 How little we respond and how much it breathes the funny things of this galaxy. <br />
 <br />
