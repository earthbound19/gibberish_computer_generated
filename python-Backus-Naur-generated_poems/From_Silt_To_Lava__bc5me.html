<h1>From Silt To Lava</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 What we say circumscribes to  <br />
 preserve some other cousin  <br />
 what a sequence may teach.  <br />
 Blossoming the cluster of her miracle full of devoted.  <br />
 The I in troupe of artists I weave as if within a fire-tipped smoke. <br />
 <br />
 Multitude of productivities!  <br />
 In and out of the transluscent marine the blue and the cinnamon  <br />
 my heart moves from being sticky to being electrical.  <br />
 Nothing but that board of directors of cries of actors. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
This tear stained hand of cards and perfuming bottle protests me  <br />
 with it's honest mirrors like lip and hips  <br />
 and blood colored armadas of ships like lip and reflections.  <br />
 I am rejected by wreath and shards of cedar, by pin and sunshine. <br />
 <br />
 Shut out and closed off like a well.  <br />
 Around the archipeligos I like to rustle like a dead ream of paper. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
My careful lip recovers you always. <br />
