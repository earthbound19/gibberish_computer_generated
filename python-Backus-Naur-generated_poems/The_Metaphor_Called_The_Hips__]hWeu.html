<h1>The Metaphor Called The Hips</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Hither the fire-tipped honeysuckle, many barbaous funerals.  <br />
 I'd do it for the essence in which you breathe  <br />
 for the rituals of crimson you've connected. <br />
 <br />
 We open the halves of a mysteries and the  <br />
 deforming of noises grows into the starry land.  <br />
 Among the pitying cities. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Of your blood colored scoop of journalists when you hold out your finger.  <br />
 If I could kiss the torrent and the archipeligos.  <br />
 Which is a celestial flock of tourists of directions  <br />
 million or two, played  <br />
 on a book or in the starry board of directors  <br />
 directions of the toe, a calculation in your legs.  <br />
 As if to abhor or upgrade or lunge. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
