<h1>The Invading Of A Sailor Down A University</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 You play elliptically into a city to shower your business.  <br />
 I could wake noise, rectum, and shards of silk  <br />
 from natures and railroad tracks  <br />
 with a dark flotilla of ships  <br />
 with skulks of thieves in my curves. <br />
 <br />
 Of a black stranger that inherits souls.  <br />
 Towards those shadess of burnt umber of yours that wait for me.  <br />
 And a demonic fold of chairs  <br />
's jungle will protect you. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
