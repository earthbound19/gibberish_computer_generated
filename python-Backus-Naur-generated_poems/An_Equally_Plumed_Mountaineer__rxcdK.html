 The cleansed clusters of things decayed it begins like a cactus amid the deck of cards. Draw from it the troubled  <br />
 detail of its own projection.  <br />
 Like neon pencil, eddies  <br />
 custodian of the depths of my foot - your loving  <br />
 stills your hidden regard as though it were plasma.  <br />
 And meetings of arrogant finger nothing but that galaxy of beauties of pastures. <br />
