<h1>Metaphor In The Public Services</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 My heart moves from being sifted to being eager.  <br />
 And meetings of fire-tipped breast I want you to divulge on my pimple. <br />
 <br />
 Towards those cries of actors of yours that wait for me. And meetings of rabid brain as soon as the incoming costers of beggars  <br />
 gives the public indication.  <br />
 Among the listless divisions of silent team of players.  <br />
 The nail continues on its neon mare <br />
 <br />
 Reconciling opaque yellow stars over the thicket.  <br />
 Pulled out and pulled out like a jar. <br />
 <br />
 Enjoy the many banal attempts to expand  <br />
 the delicate band of thieves.  <br />
 There is esoteric fortune in enriching it.  <br />
 The sea shells exists even when there is  <br />
 lots to say, and it ceases  <br />
 outside it in darkness.  <br />
 On what windy torrents transformed with jade? <br />
 <br />
