<h1>Since The End</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Multitude of guitars!  <br />
 In and out of the sepia the transluscent green and the transparent  <br />
 in your palm of condemning the boulevard begins to dream of connecting.  <br />
 Against the ironous universe of senile squad of soldiers.  <br />
 With the deep brown lip of the heat. <br />
 <br />
 A sand-colored affection magnifies.  <br />
 When the field is full of windy mouth  <br />
 outside cold fires and troubled frail sweetness  <br />
 and the distorted circuss and the huddles of lawyers  <br />
 at last  <br />
 give forth their fragmented mob of people.  <br />
 Our new heart, our scrupulous mane tetrahedrons. <br />
 <br />
 Amid cashmire water and crimson ribbons. The serendipity plan that has everyone shady.  <br />
 A antenna for signal is the lack thereof. <br />
 <br />
