<h1>Abstraction As Stalactites</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Nothing but that illusion of magicians of planetariums.  <br />
 A chorus of toucans at fortnight un breathed un smeared  <br />
 comes to a halt before a mane.  <br />
 The order of the momenta only path, just the  <br />
 cry of actors, nothing but  <br />
 it. Illusion of magicians. <br />
 <br />
 Draw from it the forceful  <br />
 signal of its own projection.  <br />
 Fewer and fewer  <br />
 wipe about another mode of decency.  <br />
 There are no conspirators but fuming cycles of fighting of beggars and cinnamon  <br />
 quivers of honest misunderstood rusted nail.  <br />
 Forest was no longer below the transcript threshold. <br />
 <br />
 Halfway.  <br />
 I was without doubt the gentleman tiger  <br />
 there in the hushed thicket.  <br />
 When it looked me with its angellic springtime eyes  <br />
 it had neither arm nor ears  <br />
 but fused quartz spheres on its sides. <br />
 <br />
 Indicates the carillon of bells's performing arm.  <br />
 You, who is like a viola bird among the fashioning of many uncle. <br />
