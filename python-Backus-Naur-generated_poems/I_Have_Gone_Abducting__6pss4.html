<h1>I Have Gone Abducting</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 I took on forceful leaves.  <br />
 And amid my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  <br />
 and full of resilient. <br />
 <br />
 Of profound lemon, spirit  <br />
 of the telegraphs,  <br />
 lunged giant blood, your kisses  <br />
 swim into exile  <br />
 and a droplet of crystal, with remnants of the chimney. Full stop.  <br />
 Cordial, gem sneer of butlers! <br />
 <br />
