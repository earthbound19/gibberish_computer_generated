<h1>The Harsh One Of The Land</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 A loaf of bread baked with browbeaten success and salt.  <br />
 A quadrangle among a circle,  <br />
 the lethargic workings of deedy law. <br />
 <br />
 And you love like a grape and in your breath of coddling the region begins to dream of awakening. Around the turqoise infuriated of the parallel cities.  <br />
 In my night at morning you are like a fighting of beggars  <br />
 and your form and colour the way I wake them.  <br />
 You are the mango of my sifted curves.  <br />
 You are going to ask where are the fill?  <br />
 And the honest tabernacles of bankers?  <br />
 And the sun hopeful splattering its roots and invading them full of  <br />
 university and turkey? <br />
 <br />
 <br />
