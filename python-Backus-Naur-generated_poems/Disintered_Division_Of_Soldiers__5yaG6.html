<h1>Disintered Division Of Soldiers</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 There are no vigils but obscene cycles of drop and sunburst orange  <br />
 choirs of singers of parsimonious tenacious sand.  <br />
 A loaf of bread baked with rabid jubilant and salt.  <br />
 The region outside hers  <br />
 a tale we divulge in passing,  <br />
 with notions of humility  <br />
 and a passion for oceanography and engineering <br />
 <br />
 So the sensible hope lives on in a lemon,  <br />
 the changeless house of the honeysuckle,  <br />
 the serene obeisance of servants that is wide and cordial. <br />
 <br />
