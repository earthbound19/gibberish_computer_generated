<h1>The Sticky Elder</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 I'm the aunt to the flight of angels of immediate tribe of natives.  <br />
 A loaf of bread baked with weak bold and salt.  <br />
 To seek another land and outside my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked  <br />
 and full of humble. <br />
 <br />
 The rusted bird perfumes convenient to the spacious talents of gamblers.  <br />
 The musical quilt gave it hope.  <br />
 You say, what is the starlight waiting for in its marine eloquence of lawyers?  <br />
 I tell you it is waiting for drunkship of cobblers like you. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
You divulge in the divisions as in a incredulous universe.  <br />
 It is a tale of dilute juices and you expand like a jar and panicky and division of soldiers - maternities of sour. <br />
 <br />
 Multitude of poppies!  <br />
 In and out of the transluscent crimson the yellow and the yellow  <br />
 in the middle of the fragmented archipeligos of absurd kiss.  <br />
 Went rescued in candle  <br />
 shine on the lards that wait for you  <br />
 deluding the violenet chairs, deluding the doors.  <br />
 From bevy of quail to litter of puppies,  <br />
 hidden hastinesses of cooks drawn by delicate channels, a  <br />
 hairy flute begins to drink. <br />
 <br />
 Realized aromatic current the pigeon hole imposes nessecity.  <br />
 You are going to ask where are the fill?  <br />
 And the steady praises?  <br />
 And the thunder naked splattering its muscles and pitying them full of  <br />
 boulevard and jaguar?  <br />
 The promise plan that  <br />
 has everyone rustling. <br />
 <br />
 A current of original thread  <br />
 that does not know why it flows and responds. <br />
