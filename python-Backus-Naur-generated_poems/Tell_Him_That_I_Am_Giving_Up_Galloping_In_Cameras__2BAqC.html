<h1>Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Galloping In Cameras</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 I took on dilute tigers.  <br />
 Transforming toward the grape I saw how choruss of angels are dedicated  <br />
 by the decisive cluster of things. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Protect on the serections that wait for you  <br />
 filtering the arrogant chairs, depriving the doors.  <br />
 And the scolding of seamstresses to its rascal of boys  <br />
 and among the atoms the hopeful one  <br />
 the astronaut covered with poetic map. <br />
 <br />
 Conversations of splendors, the recitation  <br />
 of laminated signs we call fluidic fountain. <br />
