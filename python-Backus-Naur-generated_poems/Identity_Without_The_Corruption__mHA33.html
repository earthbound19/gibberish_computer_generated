<h1>Identity Without The Corruption</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Carry me onto your train - the orange of my troupe of acrobats -  <br />
 in  <br />
 the first scene, the deedy astronaut  <br />
 is abducted by a goddess. In the second  <br />
 reel he returns, to rustle and to begin.  <br />
 You are the inevitable cousin of a iguana,  <br />
 the lonely ness of the propeller, the power of the lava.  <br />
 Here I am, a boundless hips  <br />
 dismantled in the sea of peace. <br />
 <br />
 What is this signal but a memory harassed of its crimson cars?  <br />
 A love creating will dedicate  <br />
 the careless iron of a planet.  <br />
 My heart is filled with charity like a fused quartz bouquet of flowers. <br />
 <br />
 Of a black elder that reconciles lights.  <br />
 Brings all the erupts forms.  <br />
 This fuming snow and loving forest disguises me  <br />
 with it's silent peaces like armpit and shoulder  <br />
 and rust colored quilts like ears and clusters of things. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
