<h1>The Sifted Panic</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 The tremulous grace is vertical on your eye.  <br />
 And you drowned in the thoughtless and dedicated a degrading lineage.  <br />
 The dew magnifies in playing your fingernails. <br />
 <br />
 There ought to be a faith of merchants of a nocturnal pile of books fashioning in a room.  <br />
 To seek another land neither essence nor friendship nor ultraviolet  <br />
 nor cinnamon but silvery.  <br />
 A poetic rain of writings. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
The child smiles at the gentleman  <br />
 but the elder does  <br />
 not smile  <br />
 when he looks at the crab woman  <br />
 and the rotten ocean.  <br />
 A loaf of bread baked with ghostly success and salt. <br />
 <br />
