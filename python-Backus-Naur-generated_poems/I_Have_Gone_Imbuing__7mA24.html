<h1>I Have Gone Imbuing</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Come with me to the flask of ghosts.  <br />
 Gleaming empire. The bezier functions to seek a context  <br />
 to its system.  <br />
 The essential fold of chairs gave it thoughtful. <br />
 <br />
 You are the banana of my weak eye.  <br />
 To the absorbant self-assured sun nobody here is waiting for the next army of soldiers.  <br />
 Landscape. You circumscribed yourself for playing.  <br />
 Halfway. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
To flutter lost saxophones and for phemonanas.  <br />
 A tabernacle of bankers mixing will trust  <br />
 the lashed steel of a planet. <br />
 <br />
 When the room is full of sordid nose  <br />
 in receptacles and communist dead cathedrals  <br />
 and the fire-tipped foliages and the hearts  <br />
 at last give forth their weak malapertness of pedlars.  <br />
 When the field is full of bitten heart  <br />
 with talents of gamblers and imperalist rotten divisions of soldiers  <br />
 and the dilute convoys of trucks and the pullulations  <br />
 at last give forth their browbeaten smoke. <br />
 <br />
 And so that its cities will deprive your eyes.  <br />
 For troupe of acrobats  <br />
 was wet-winged and morally positive.  <br />
 Of your blood colored obeisance of servants when you hold out your foot.  <br />
 As if to harass or re-cover or hate. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
