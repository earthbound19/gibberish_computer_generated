<h1>It Responded With Benches Of Judges</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Inside the bitter moonlight evening of imperalist silken architecture.  <br />
 Towards those convoys of trucks of yours that wait for me. <br />
 <br />
 The I in flesh I salute your esoteric plum  <br />
 and  <br />
 envy your aquatic pride. A misunderstood bale of wool day  <br />
 and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  <br />
 entertain of writings and bevies of beauties  <br />
 and the homogeneous bird feathers of his native land? <br />
