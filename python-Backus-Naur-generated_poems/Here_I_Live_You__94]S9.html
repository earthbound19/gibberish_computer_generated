<h1>Here I Live You</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Of your red lake when you hold out your mouth.  <br />
 What we say drinks to  <br />
 breathe some other mountaineer  <br />
 what a metaphor may teach.  <br />
 You are the chaotic cousin of a bird,  <br />
 the hollow ness of the land, the power of the lava.  <br />
 The custodian smiles at the lady  <br />
 but the pioneer does not smile  <br />
 when he looks at the pheasant lady  <br />
 and the fatherless ocean. <br />
