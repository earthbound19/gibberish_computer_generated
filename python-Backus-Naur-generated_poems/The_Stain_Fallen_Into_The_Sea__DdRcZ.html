<h1>The Stain Fallen Into The Sea</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 It is a tale of mechanical oxides  <br />
 the rambunctious ostrich treads about the nocturnal blades.  <br />
 Obscene weather, tenacious lights like the fragrance of strawberry.  <br />
 You are going to ask where are the fill?  <br />
 And the velvety pads of paper?  <br />
 And the wind winged splattering its bird feathers and imprisoning them full of  <br />
 archipeligos and tiger?  <br />
 He is afar from us at this moment of first galloping. <br />
 <br />
 Not to enchant or even meet  <br />
 the troupe of artists of one who wets  <br />
 near to me in a night or rescuing to a stranger.  <br />
 Your mouth returns from north to south <br />
 <br />
 We open the halves of a phenomena and the  <br />
 wiping of jugulars chirps into the angellic thicket.  <br />
 Of a blood colored sailor that returns reams of paper. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
