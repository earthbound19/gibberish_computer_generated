<h1>I Expected Uncles</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Here I am, a smooth breath drowned in the sea of troop of soldiers. The fluidic dignity of the thread!  <br />
 The skeleton bird returns hither the enduring sticks. <br />
 <br />
 Of parsimonious peach, spirit  <br />
 of the keys,  <br />
 degraded gentleman blood, your kisses  <br />
 dawn into exile  <br />
 and a droplet of ceramic, with remnants of the room.  <br />
 Dazzled is gone, the subject has breathed.  <br />
 I saw how smooth irons are rejoiced  <br />
 by the delicate prize.  <br />
 Sometimes a piece of the brass  <br />
 faints like a caste of bread in my nose. <br />
