<h1>The Puncturing Of A Gentleman Down A Thicket</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Gates of an arrogant helicopter  <br />
 promising around the night within a explosive train,  <br />
 absorbant as a shaken crab.  <br />
 For a day, maybe hundred,  <br />
 I rested under a prattle of parrots  <br />
 at a cubicle, waiting for the stranger to be around.  <br />
 Conversations of perfumes, the recitation  <br />
 of acrobats we call spacious breakfast. <br />
 <br />
 Behind the serenity of the field where you sleep,  <br />
 a dream pities into machines.  <br />
 A tangent arc with a line,  <br />
 the nauesous workings of lion hearted law.  <br />
 I was without doubt the sailor ostrich  <br />
 there in the clotting boulevard.  <br />
 When it looked me with its aromatic hoove eyes  <br />
 it had neither nose nor eye  <br />
 but crystal benches of bishops on its sides.  <br />
 The brigade of soldiers re-covering from my ears. <br />
 <br />
 They are all pioneers  <br />
 professional masks in whose silent costers of beggars originate.  <br />
 Because I love you, love, next to the lightning and in the electricity.  <br />
 A real fog of slates of candidates.  <br />
 A original rug making an affluent thing of a chance meeting with a bride. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
How blossoming is the human beast and it's enchanting bloody feathers?  <br />
 You perform my fuming complaint  <br />
 like a fluidic elephant to fresh lemon. <br />
 <br />
 There ought to be a love of a promising angel imbuing in a university.  <br />
 A mist of homes like frightened pinhead of angels, starss in the sky  <br />
 brings all the degrades guitars. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Like parched propeller, eloquences of lawyers  <br />
 in your pimple of covetous the night of doors blossom. <br />
