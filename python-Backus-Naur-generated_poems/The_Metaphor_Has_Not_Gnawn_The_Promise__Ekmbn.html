<h1>The Metaphor Has Not Gnawn The Promise</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 My heart is filled with bold like a bolt of emerald forest.  <br />
 In my universe at fortnight you are like a snow  <br />
 and your form and colour the way I weave them.  <br />
 Neither escheat of lawyers nor ream of paper nor opaque gray  <br />
 nor sunburst orange but crimson. <br />
 <br />
 I am brainwashed by eloquence of lawyers and bomb, by extinction and fog.  <br />
 The gypsum gleaming deaths are coagulated.  <br />
 A oily metaphor hates  <br />
 even the myriad  <br />
 side land in language  <br />
 to which the metaphor  <br />
 will not be upgraded. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Like the nauesous graphite of echoes I salute your steady peach  <br />
 and envy your eager pride.  <br />
 Outside cashmire water and opaque silvery silences. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
