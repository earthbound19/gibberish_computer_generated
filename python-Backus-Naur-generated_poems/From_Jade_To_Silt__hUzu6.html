<h1>From Jade To Silt</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 To attract lost pullulations and for doctrines of doctors.  <br />
 A mouth and a mouth  <br />
 refreshing the chimney.  <br />
 A train is not enough to dismantle me and keep me  <br />
 from the sea of your equinoctial mysteries.  <br />
 Enjoy the many whirlwinds of attempts to begin  <br />
 the perfect ghost.  <br />
 There is fresh fortune in responding it. <br />
 <br />
 Around the thicket I like to connect like a bitter dew.  <br />
 The starlight plan that has everyone inaccessible. <br />
 <br />
 And meetings  <br />
 of fire-tipped palm from cluster of grapes to litter of cubs,  <br />
 hidden blasts of hunters drawn by irreducable channels,  <br />
 a  <br />
 rotten promise begins to preserve. <br />
