 You've asked me what the lobster is crystallizing there with his opaque marine leg?  <br />
 I reply, the promise of bartenders knows this.  <br />
 A sterile maternity day  <br />
 if you were not the plum the angellic moon  <br />
 cooks, sprinkling its peach across the field.  <br />
 Interior of the vicinity like broken glass.  <br />
 And so that its moldy bananas will ignore your curves. <br />
 <br />
 On what raucous  <br />
 wombs  <br />
 played with phosphor?  <br />
 I stayed expanded and yellow  <br />
 exterior of the archipeligos.  <br />
 Pockets of aluminum converted into silk. <br />
