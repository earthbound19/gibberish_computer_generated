<h1>Since The Beginning Of Galloping</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Multitude of flints!  <br />
 In and out of the yellow the burnt umber and the sunburst orange  <br />
 from parade of penguins to gang of elk,  <br />
 hidden teams of players drawn by sanguine channels, a  <br />
 tenacious rascal of boys begins to flow.  <br />
 It loves like a promise outside the mist.  <br />
 Multitude of crews of sailors!  <br />
 In and out of the opaque sepia the green and the transluscent transluscent silvery <br />
 <br />
 To the myriad color of the silk choir of singers. <br />
 <br />
 A chorus of angels -like clock  <br />
 you've asked me what the oyster is connecting there with his silvery loins?  <br />
 I reply, the curtain knows this.  <br />
 She is outside us at this moment of first preserving. <br />
 <br />
 And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  <br />
 dawn of umbrellas and sea shells  <br />
 and the parenthetical guitars of his native land? My heart is filled with wary like a ivory wine bottle.  <br />
 The lunchtime battalions of soldiers you in its mortal aluminum.  <br />
 The star awakens in chirping your eye.  <br />
 What is this phenomenon but a memory  <br />
 passed of its salts? <br />
 <br />
 <br />
