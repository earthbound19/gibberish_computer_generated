<h1>The Demonic Sailor Of The Land</h1>

<p>
 I could hear bone, lineage, and cadaver  <br />
 from mists and musters of soldiers  <br />
 with a brimstone superfluity of nuns  <br />
 with legless horses in my breast.  <br />
 Draw from it the inevitable  <br />
 projection of its own metaphor. <br />
 <br />
 Like moldy bananas compounding inside precisions. We open the halves of a mysteries and the  <br />
 dismantling of bones makes into the honest field.  <br />
 A rain of utensils silence was no longer above the log threshold. <br />
