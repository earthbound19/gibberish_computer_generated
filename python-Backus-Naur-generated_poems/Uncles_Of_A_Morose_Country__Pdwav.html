<h1>Uncles Of A Morose Country</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Within the changing bombs.  <br />
 A full wood paneling making a serendipidous thing of a chance meeting with a cousin.  <br />
 In my jungle at sunrise you are like a kis  <br />
 and your form and colour the way I transform them.  <br />
 In the smallest glass sun a wheel is not enough to twist me and keep me  <br />
 from the vicinity of your humble mysteries. <br />
 <br />
 A chorus of turkeys at fortnight un recovered un deprived  <br />
 comes to a halt before a huddle of players.  <br />
 Fewer and fewer  <br />
 drown about another mode of earnest. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Return to the homeland of the circuss.  <br />
 A loop in front of a tangent arc,  <br />
 the hollow workings of original law. <br />
 <br />
