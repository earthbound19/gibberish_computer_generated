<h1>Meeting Your Explication</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 In the smallest  <br />
 ceramic wing of aircraft full stop.  <br />
 Enjoy the many crooked attempts to preserve  <br />
 the promising conspirator.  <br />
 There is naked fortune in kissing it.  <br />
 Halfway. <br />
 <br />
 I want you to pacify on my fingernails.  <br />
 Has the jungle been understood with funny things?  <br />
 Everything crooked with sensual voices, the salt of the dove  <br />
 and piles of promising bread around morning.  <br />
 What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another. <br />
 <br />
 Like coals crushing outside damnings of jurors.  <br />
 Everyone here is waiting for the next praise.  <br />
 Giggle of girls. You swam yourself for conducting.  <br />
 Realized delicious springtime halfway. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
You - the hidden hand.  <br />
 The gardens exists even when there is  <br />
 little to say, and it ceases  <br />
 outside it in darkness. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
The order of the bells my heart moves from being phosphorus to being starry.  <br />
 I'm the aunt to the anthology of poems of immediate lighthouse. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
