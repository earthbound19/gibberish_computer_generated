<h1>The Phenomenon Called The Loins</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 To seek another land went played in umbrella  <br />
 upgrade on the pamphlets that wait for you  <br />
 deceiving the bitterest chairs, abducting the doors.  <br />
 Carry me onto your vessel - the kiwi of my praise - <br />
 <br />
 A square around a quadrangle,  <br />
 the delirious workings of poetic law. The ribbon plan that has everyone disintered.  <br />
 My heart moves from being calculating to being silent.  <br />
 You are the kiwi of my senile  <br />
 lip. <br />
 <br />
 You say, what is the hat waiting for in its cashmire glaze of tourists?  <br />
 I tell you it is waiting for light like you.  <br />
 I'm the son to the branch of immediate writing.  <br />
 We get the abstraction  <br />
 they must lots to enrich  <br />
 to each other  <br />
 or perhaps nothing but covens of witches.  <br />
 Perhaps they are not wiped.  <br />
 The serene keys passed they are all pioneers  <br />
 professional unctions of undertakers in whose delicate doves originate.  <br />
 My heart moves from being dry to being nocturnal. <br />
 <br />
 My velvety arm crystallizes you always.  <br />
 It was the fortnight of the turkey.  <br />
 I am imprisoned by key and alarm, by error and mist.  <br />
 As soon as the incoming obeisances of servants  <br />
 gives the minor indication. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
It was the sunset of the toucan.  <br />
 Carry me onto your car - the mango of my deck of cards - <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Of a red sailor that relaxes schools of clerks.  <br />
 Sometimes a piece of the salt  <br />
 executes like a heart in my breast. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
