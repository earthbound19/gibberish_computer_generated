<h1>The Careless God Of The Field</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 I do not change in the universe of windy polyp.  <br />
 You are the tear stained astronaut of a elephant,  <br />
 the misunderstood ness of the bench of bishops, the power of the tin. <br />
 <br />
 There are no pigeon holes but shady cycles of tree and transluscent silvery  <br />
 panels of experts of blazing inaccessible steel.  <br />
 To seek another land indicates the map's loving eyelids.  <br />
 If you were not the orange the hopeful moon  <br />
 cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the thicket.  <br />
 Shut out and pulled out like a stalks of cattail. <br />
 <br />
 Amid the blood colored vicious of the wasteland.  <br />
 Within the smearing roosters. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
