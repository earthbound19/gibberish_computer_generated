<h1>Near To Neutral Understanding - Images And Photography</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 The mosaic conducting from my brain.  <br />
 It is a tale of absurd vigils with sepia water and cashmire companies of actors.  <br />
 A current of full carillon of bells  <br />
 that does not know why it flows and transforms.  <br />
 Not the burnt umber moment  <br />
 when the sunrise swims the drops. <br />
 <br />
 Our new impatience of wives, our lovely queue of actors tetrahedrons.  <br />
 There ought to be a fellowship of a resplendent lunar wetting in a city.  <br />
 A arrogant metaphor replaces  <br />
 even the winged  <br />
 minor moonlight evening in signal  <br />
 to which the metaphor  <br />
 will not be drank. <br />
 <br />
 A study relinquishes,  <br />
 deludes - it does not  <br />
 return.  <br />
 What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  <br />
 Sometimes a piece of the aluminum  <br />
 strikes like a blush of boys in my chest. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
What overflows the props of kindness?  <br />
 Has the jungle been shone with secrets? <br />
 <br />
 Shaken evils and wounded smokes.  <br />
 Pockets of brush converted into ivory.  <br />
 All necklaces become cities.  <br />
 Like depths killing next to evening stars. <br />
 <br />
 I salute your vertical bread  <br />
 and envy your slender pride.  <br />
 Like tenacious paper-mache architecture, scoldings of seamstresses  <br />
 not the marine moment  <br />
 when the fortnight swims the trees.  <br />
 Pockets of rusted nail converted into silicon. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
