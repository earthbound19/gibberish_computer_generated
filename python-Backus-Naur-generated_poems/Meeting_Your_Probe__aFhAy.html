<h1>Meeting Your Probe</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 And networks of computers and sneers of butlers.  <br />
 This dead sea shell and living quiver decays me  <br />
 with it's serendipidous panels of experts like armpit and eyeballs  <br />
 and red carillons of bells like hand and boards of directors. <br />
 <br />
 Landscape.  <br />
 And the tree to its harmony of singers  <br />
 and among the curtains the parenthetical one  <br />
 the fisherman covered with profound lemon. <br />
 <br />
 Bed of a devoured distorted aroma.  <br />
 Indicates the wave's forming hand.  <br />
 The morning railroad tracks you in its mortal phosphor.  <br />
 What myriad propellers -  <br />
 the area is filled with it,  <br />
 cries of players for the kis and the communist crystal. <br />
 <br />
