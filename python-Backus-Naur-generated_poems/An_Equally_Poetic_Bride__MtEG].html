<h1>An Equally Poetic Bride</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 In the smallest paper-mache ripple my heart moves  <br />
 from being insatiable to being homogeneous. I'd do it for the drop in which you play  <br />
 for the choirs of angels of green you've attracted.  <br />
 And so that its consequences will crack your eyelids.  <br />
 Silvery and electrical pioneer, <br />
 <br />
 From her fingernails and her eye hear  <br />
 candles of the earth.  <br />
 Where  <br />
 affections meet  <br />
 companies of soldiers meet, outside and outside and the sound  <br />
 of skulks of thieves, to reach out and drink in intolerant.  <br />
 A current of poetic library of books  <br />
 that does not know why it flows and loves. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
A transparent choir of singers preserves.  <br />
 Within the opaque rust colored disdainful of the wasteland. <br />
 <br />
 And so that its whispers will taunt your finger.  <br />
 Closed off and pulled out like a glaze of tourists. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
