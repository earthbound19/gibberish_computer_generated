<h1>There Is No Circumstance</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 You are going to ask where are the fill?  <br />
 And the careful batches of bread?  <br />
 And the sun lyrical splattering its crowds of people and twisting them full of  <br />
 field and elephant?  <br />
 You grow my insufferable bloodied obsidian  <br />
 like a electrical squirrel to fresh sugar. <br />
 <br />
 Around the gray animosity of the noise.  <br />
 And with my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  <br />
 and full of uplifting.  <br />
 But I should be inconsistent with science, coddling among its lonely love  <br />
 so let us begin to tell a story without technical redundancies.  <br />
 You say, what is the movie waiting for in its marine well?  <br />
 I tell you it is waiting for miracle like you. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
You see chest as serendipidous as the drizzle.  <br />
 You are the tomato of my spoiled shoulder. <br />
 <br />
