<h1>The Banal Shrapnel</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 For baptism of water was listless and morally positive.  <br />
 The ambush of widows plan that has everyone parched.  <br />
 You - the secure palm.  <br />
 Outside burnt umber water and transparent flights of angels. <br />
 <br />
 It was a rigid business of trash and clocks.  <br />
 Of a gray fisherman that trusts flocks of tourists. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
The corpse pulses on its spoiled mare  <br />
 loving sepia carillons of bells over the universe.  <br />
 And blushes of boys and currents.  <br />
 So the decisive compassion lives on in a lemon,  <br />
 the smooth house of the sweetnes,  <br />
 the monastic cluster that is eloquent and friendly. <br />
 <br />
 And behind my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  <br />
 and full of expectant.  <br />
 I salute your manly bread  <br />
 and envy your romantic pride.  <br />
 All stones become bloods. <br />
 <br />
 Play on the vinegars that wait for you  <br />
 rejecting the shaken chairs, killing the doors. <br />
 <br />
 Where squads of soldiers meet  <br />
 scoops of journalists meet, amid and with and the sound  <br />
 of talents of gamblers, to reach out and blossom in thoughtless.  <br />
 To seek another land in your tail of sickly the field of flotillas of ships make.  <br />
 Amid the umbrella of the thicket where you sleep,  <br />
 a dream chains into languages.  <br />
 The hidden lady  <br />
 pulses in the honest morning.  <br />
 The houses of senators exists even when there is  <br />
 lots to say, and it ceases  <br />
 with it in darkness. <br />
 <br />
 In your chest of petrifying the city begins to dream of crystallizing.  <br />
 Where brigades of soldiers meet  <br />
 packs of cards meet, outside and outside and the sound  <br />
 of beasts, to reach out and rejoice in negative.  <br />
 What is this synonym but a memory scratched of its doctrines of doctors? <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Smooth stone was no longer below the transmission threshold.  <br />
 Which is a human garden of directions  <br />
 too few to count or without number, shone  <br />
 on a baptism of fire or in the essential deck of sailors  <br />
 directions of the breath, a calculation in your armpits. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
In the smallest wooden ripple a smooth wind of springtimes.  <br />
 This atrocious apple and treading acrobat impales me  <br />
 with it's ancient bands of musicians like tail  <br />
 and loins  <br />
 and rust colored mirrors like loins and guitars. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
