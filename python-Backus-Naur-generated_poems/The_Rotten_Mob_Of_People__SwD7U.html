<h1>The Rotten Mob Of People</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 To mix lost armadas of ships and for saxophones.  <br />
 Connecting a goring of butchers  <br />
 preserved in the absent minded rain.  <br />
 There are many incantations of witches inside dead events.  <br />
 A foot and a brain  <br />
 gathering the chimney. <br />
 <br />
 The cousin smiles at the cousin  <br />
 but the lady does not smile  <br />
 when he looks at the tiger cousin  <br />
 and the fuming ocean. <br />
 <br />
 What phenomena does the crab contain?  <br />
 How little we relinquish and how much it responds the epiphany of this galaxy. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
To shine lost schools and for troupes of acrobats.  <br />
 You are going to ask where are the fill?  <br />
 And the fresh forms?  <br />
 And the fog eloquent splattering its homes and ignoring them full of  <br />
 region and oyster?  <br />
 A sunburst orange bouquet of flowers preserves.  <br />
 A ship is not enough to loathe me and keep me  <br />
 from the thicket of your parenthetical curiosities. <br />
 <br />
  <br />
