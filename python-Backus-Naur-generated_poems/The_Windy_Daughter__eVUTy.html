<h1>The Windy Daughter</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 The copper starry blades are deprived.  <br />
 Neither glaze of tourists nor coat nor dark  <br />
 nor cashmire but transluscent sand-colored.  <br />
 You say, what is the click of computer mice waiting for in its sunburst orange sun?  <br />
 I tell you it is waiting for phemonana like you. <br />
 <br />
 I want you to circumscribe on my breath.  <br />
 She is betwixt us at this moment of first blushing.  <br />
 Sometimes  <br />
 a piece of the brass  <br />
 impales like a chorus of angels in my toe. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
You are going to ask where are the fill?  <br />
 And the blazing poppies?  <br />
 And the drizzle delicate splattering its shadess of crimson and fainting them full of  <br />
 boulevard and iguana?  <br />
 Come with me to the cummerbund of extinctions. <br />
 <br />
 All souffles of clouds become quarrels of lawyers. For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  <br />
 I rested under a dazzle of zebras  <br />
 at a cubicle, waiting for the man to be amid.  <br />
 How chirping is the electrical clock and it's full lonely roads? <br />
 <br />
 <br />
