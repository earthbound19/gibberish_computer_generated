<h1>I Have Gone Circumscribing</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 A raft is not enough to deceive me and keep me  <br />
 from the university of your naked mysteries. You see leg as delicious as the clouds.  <br />
 When you perch lighted like an aspen.  <br />
 I'd do it for the chorus of singers in which you relax  <br />
 for the decks of sailors of sepia you've circumscribed. <br />
 <br />
 Come with me to the massacre of abberations.  <br />
 You say, what is the caste of bread waiting for in its sand-colored emerald architecture?  <br />
 I tell you it is waiting for troupe of dancers like you.  <br />
 Be guided by the gleaming parliament of beggars's shuffle of bureaucrats. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
What parsimonious souls -  <br />
 the universe is filled with it,  <br />
 maps for the band of musicians and the guilt paper-mache.  <br />
 Outside the sunburst orange eyes of the copper. <br />
 <br />
 Conversations of tribes of natives, the recitation  <br />
 of flags we call balanced parliament of beggars.  <br />
 The gentleman smiles at the father  <br />
 but the goddess does not smile  <br />
 when he looks at the squirrel child  <br />
 and the tenacious ocean.  <br />
 A chorus of toucans at day un pacified un bristled  <br />
 comes to a halt before a troupe of artists.  <br />
 I stayed expanded and sunburst orange  <br />
 under the jungle. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
