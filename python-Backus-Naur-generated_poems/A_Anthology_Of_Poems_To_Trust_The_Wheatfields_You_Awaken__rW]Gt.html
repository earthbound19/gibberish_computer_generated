<h1>A Anthology Of Poems To Trust The Wheatfields You Awaken</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Has the university been enchanted with epiphany?  <br />
 Opaque marine oblivions of twisting lonely road,  <br />
 sunburst orange seams above a mechanical brigade of soldiers. <br />
 <br />
 You see arm as cosmic as  <br />
 the sunshine. In my field at sunset  <br />
 you are like a peace  <br />
 and your form and colour the way I circumscribe them.  <br />
 Blue and winged stranger, <br />
 <br />
 <br />
