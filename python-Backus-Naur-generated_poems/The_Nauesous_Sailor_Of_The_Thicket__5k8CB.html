<h1>The Nauesous Sailor Of The Thicket</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 This boney echo and magnifying fleet of ships shatters me  <br />
 with it's mineral peals of bells like pimple and arm  <br />
 and dull shades of transparent angels like tail and veins.  <br />
 They compounded it with boneless windows.  <br />
 From her breast and her mouth  <br />
 build  <br />
 maps of the earth.  <br />
 What secure laminated signs -  <br />
 the thicket is filled with it,  <br />
 sea shells for the autumn and the demonic cedar. <br />
 <br />
 Everything tenacious with irreducable voices, the salt of the grace  <br />
 and piles  <br />
 of solute bread behind night.  <br />
 A scrupulous carpet making a velvety thing of a likely  <br />
 meeting with a pioneer.  <br />
 For network of computers was bitter and morally negative. <br />
 <br />
 You are going to ask where are the fill?  <br />
 And the pure poppies? <br />
 <br />
 And the mist enduring splattering its bunches of things and pampering them full of  <br />
 moonlight evening and oyster?  <br />
 Towards those battalions of soldiers of yours that wait for me.  <br />
 The worships of writers exists even when there is  <br />
 little to say, and it ceases  <br />
 within it in shadow.  <br />
 So the comfortable loyalty lives on in a grape,  <br />
 the fresh house of the team  <br />
 of players,  <br />
 the aromatic honeysuckle that is verdure and fluidic. <br />
 <br />
 A chorus of birds at lunchtime un developed un scratched  <br />
 comes to a halt before a crew of sailors. <br />
