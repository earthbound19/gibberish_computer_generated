<h1>A Song Of Uneasy</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 To fashion lost crews of sailors and for gaggles of women.  <br />
 This disordered droplet and wetting affection abhors me  <br />
 with it's arcane phalanxes of umbrellas like heart and curves  <br />
 and black abominable sight of monkss like hand and ribbons. <br />
 <br />
 If I could dawn the moth and the chimney.  <br />
 They are all sons  <br />
 professional  <br />
 funerals in whose monastic bunches of things originate. <br />
 <br />
 A current of homogeneous phalanx of umbrellas  <br />
 that does not  <br />
 know why it flows and protects. <br />
