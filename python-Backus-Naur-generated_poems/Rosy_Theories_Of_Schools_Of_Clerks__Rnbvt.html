 I make as if among a putrid havoc.  <br />
 From fluther of jellyfish to lounge  <br />
 of lizards,  <br />
 hidden bouquets of flowers drawn by secure channels, a  <br />
 explosive hat begins to stand. <br />
 <br />
 It was a hairy business of cleft and walls.  <br />
 A gleaming wood paneling making a gleaming thing of a likely  <br />
 meeting with a god.  <br />
 It is a tale  <br />
 of careless jugulars some enrich but I rustle your broken glass like company of soldiers.  <br />
 The verdure pasture gave it charity. <br />
 <br />
 Malicious and flotilla of ships - babbles of barbers of loneliness.  <br />
 The silence knows this,  <br />
 that life in it's crystal boxes is as endless as the perfume. <br />
 <br />
