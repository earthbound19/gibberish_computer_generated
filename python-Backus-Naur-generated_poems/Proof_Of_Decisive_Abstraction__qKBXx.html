<h1>Proof Of Decisive Abstraction</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 And retinues of players and benches of judges.  <br />
 Shut out and shut up like a choir of singers. <br />
 <br />
 You are the tomato of my acidulous chest.  <br />
 Only clotting and to a  <br />
 man they take on time,  <br />
 exceeding many years  <br />
 sometimes a piece of the silt  <br />
 wets like a host of angels in my finger.  <br />
 Only trouser, just the  <br />
 coster of beggars, nothing but  <br />
 it. Team of players. <br />
 <br />
 But I should be untrue to oceanography, wiping among its wounded prizes  <br />
 so let us try to tell a story without alphabetic redundancies.  <br />
 The reasons for my respect  <br />
 are pacified in my eye of ivory.  <br />
 Pockets of steel converted into silken. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
The change of bells plan that has everyone tremulous.  <br />
 And fleets of ships and boasts of soldiers. <br />
 <br />
