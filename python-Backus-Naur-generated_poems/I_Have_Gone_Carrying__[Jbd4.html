<p>
 The mother smiles at the stranger  <br />
 but the person does not smile  <br />
 when he looks at the squirrel elder  <br />
 and the hairy ocean.  <br />
 The I in serendipity what epiphany does the lobster contain?  <br />
 How little we pulse and how much it continues the mysteries of this universe.  <br />
 A romantic thunder of galaxies  <br />
 of beauties.  <br />
 Like the insatiable metal of sea shells what free pinheads of angels -  <br />
 the boulevard is filled with it,  <br />
 stalkss of cattail for the bird feather and the mourning gold. <br />
 <br />
 Not to preserve or even meet  <br />
 the brigade of soldiers of one who circumscribes  <br />
 convenient to me in a night or appreciating to a stranger.  <br />
 Caste of bread.  <br />
 My heart is filled with wild like a silicon springtime. <br />
