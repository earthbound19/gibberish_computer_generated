<h1>Mingling Careless Nostalgia</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 When you flow like reflection stood by the fire.  <br />
 You play in the jungle as in a comfortable archipeligos. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
You respond my fragmented bramble  <br />
 like a wonderful lobster to fresh grape.  <br />
 Because I love you, love, outside the lightning and inside the ice. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Our new stars in the sky, our affluent flag tangent arcs.  <br />
 The aquatic lady  <br />
 attracts in the deedy morning.  <br />
 Like eternities coddling amid sea's skins.  <br />
 I'm the mother to the congregation of people of immediate eloquence of lawyers. <br />
 <br />
 It's a preserving congregation of people of enemies.  <br />
 To enrich lost pullulations and for costers of beggars.  <br />
 In the first scene, the esoteric stranger  <br />
 is fell by a father. In the second  <br />
 reel he returns, to love and to tread. <br />
 <br />
