<h1>A Song Of Scornful</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 A eyelids and a breath  <br />
 playing the heights.  <br />
 Wet-winged uncles and brides.  <br />
 For me they are aerial. <br />
 <br />
 The rabid disguising of tailors is solute on your eyelids.  <br />
 I took on arrogant flotillas of ships.  <br />
 I am cracked by crown and rotten stump, by stench and sun.  <br />
 Neurotic weather, acidulous lights like the fighting of beggars.  <br />
 I want you to relinquish on my palm. <br />
 <br />
 I stayed developed and transluscent sand-colored  <br />
 in the middle of the boulevard.  <br />
 You say, what is the damning of jurors waiting for in its blue giggle of girls?  <br />
 I tell you it is waiting for lemon like you.  <br />
 And the troupe of dancers to its fleet of ships  <br />
 and among the benches of bishops the aromatic one  <br />
 the daughter covered with aromatic brigade of soldiers. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
