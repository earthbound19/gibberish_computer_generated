<p>
 I took on brutal angels.  <br />
 The I in huddle of houses you gather in the archipeligos as in a indespensable vicinity. <br />
 <br />
 Not to pulse or even meet  <br />
 the change of bells of one who re-covers  <br />
 behind me in a chimney  <br />
 or returning to a father.  <br />
 Sometimes a piece of the heat  <br />
 deprives like an atom in my leg. <br />
 <br />
 In your hand of overflowing the chimney begins to dream of chirping. <br />
