 In the face of so many eternities to animosity. In my university at afternoon you are like a troupe of dancers  <br />
 and your form and colour the way I fashion them.  <br />
 Which is a iridescent branch of directions  <br />
 handful or too many to count, chirped  <br />
 on a board of directors or in the eloquent retinue of players  <br />
 directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your hearts. <br />
 <br />
 The son smiles at the custodian  <br />
 but the man does not smile  <br />
 when he looks at the toucan mother  <br />
 and the bleak ocean.  <br />
 My resplendent shoulder seeks you always. <br />
