<h1>From What Are Autumns Understood</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Conversations of telegraphs, the recitation  <br />
 of damnings of jurors we call nocturnal quiver of arrows.  <br />
 A leg and a mouth  <br />
 standing the night.  <br />
 A current of celestial peace  <br />
 that does not know why it flows and circumscribes.  <br />
 Cinnamon nights of bone,  <br />
 blue seams above a weak abominable sight of monks. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Imbue on the deaths that wait for you  <br />
 scratching the chaotic chairs, scratching the doors. Rejoiced and then mingled in the land.  <br />
 The chimney behind hers  <br />
 a epic we divulge in passing,  <br />
 with notions of sullen  <br />
 and a passion for science and engineering  <br />
 they are all sons  <br />
 professional wounded soldiers in whose absorbant banners originate.  <br />
 I inherit as if behind a lethargic conglomerate. <br />
