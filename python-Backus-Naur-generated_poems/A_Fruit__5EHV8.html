<p>
 The I in crown I was without doubt the mountaineer iguana  <br />
 there in the wet-winged land.  <br />
 When it looked me with its moonlit change of bells eyes  <br />
 it had neither brain nor eye  <br />
 but gem fightings of beggars on its sides.  <br />
 To appreciate  <br />
 lost bells and for pinheads of angels.  <br />
 Full stop.  <br />
 I salute your absorbant plum  <br />
 and envy your ancient pride. <br />
