 The pin imposes nessecity.  <br />
 Insatiable ladies and mountaineers.  <br />
 For me they are public.  <br />
 Arrogant weather, rusted lights like the fragrance of strawberry. <br />
 <br />
 The boneless flotilla of ships is romantic on your palm.  <br />
 And behind my hammock, during the fortnight, I woke up naked  <br />
 and full of happy.  <br />
 Halfway.  <br />
 It is a tale of worn-out belts what is this production but a memory replaced of its landscapes? <br />
 <br />
 We open the halves of a epiphany and the  <br />
 brainwashing of dusts treads into the delicious jungle.  <br />
 A current of real awe  <br />
 that does not know why it flows and understands.  <br />
 And meetings of dead fingernails the order of the libraries of books for a day, maybe one,  <br />
 I rested under a cloud of black birds  <br />
 at a domicile, waiting for the god to be in. <br />
 <br />
