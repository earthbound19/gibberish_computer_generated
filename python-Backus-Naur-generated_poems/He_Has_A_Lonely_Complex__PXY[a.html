<h1>He Has A Lonely Complex</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 A flute fashioning will flutter  <br />
 the inevitable salt of a planet.  <br />
 The friendship plan that has everyone motionless.  <br />
 Because I love you, love, next to the copper and outside the gypsum. <br />
 <br />
 A phenomenon preserves,  <br />
 drops - it does not return.  <br />
 Not the crimson moment  <br />
 when the night weaves the necklaces.  <br />
 Like nails smothering behind peals of bells. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Shall we move on?  <br />
 The ore fluidic alarms are killed. <br />
 <br />
