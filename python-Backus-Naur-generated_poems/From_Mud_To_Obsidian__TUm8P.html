<p>
 The order of the stars the heights in front of hers  <br />
 a story we tell in passing,  <br />
 with notions of impartial  <br />
 and a passion for oceanography and computer science  <br />
 the fire-tipped crab hears behind the eager phlegms.  <br />
 Carry me onto your airplane - the orange of my drunkship of cobblers -  <br />
 where impatiences of wives meet  <br />
 defenders meet, around and inside and the sound  <br />
 of yeasts, to reach out and upgrade in anxious. <br />
 <br />
 In my modern office at twilight you are like a faith of merchants  <br />
 and your form and colour the way I relinquish them.  <br />
 Next to the burnt umber  <br />
 ears of the silica.  <br />
 You perch annoyingly into a sea to continue your business. <br />
