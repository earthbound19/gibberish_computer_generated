<h1>A Banana</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Decisive, silken blush of boys! The absurd iguana rustles behind the sensual bones.  <br />
 When the heights is full of phosphorus shoulder  <br />
 in oxides and fatherless careless manes  <br />
 and the insatiable condescencions of actors and the foams  <br />
 at last give forth their sifted beast. <br />
 <br />
 Always you fly through the sunrise  <br />
 toward the lunchtime cracking  <br />
 faiths of merchants.  <br />
 How drinking is the brandishing croak and it's incredulous billows of dark smoke? <br />
 <br />
 The wind absorbant corruptions are struck.  <br />
 Tryst of a ignored torrential bench of judges. <br />
 <br />
