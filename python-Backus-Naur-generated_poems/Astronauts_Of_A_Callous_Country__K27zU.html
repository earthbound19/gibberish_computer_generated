<h1>Astronauts Of A Callous Country</h1>

<p>
 The reasons for my respect  <br />
 are fluttered in my curves of diamond.  <br />
 When the heights is full of rabid eye  <br />
 next to vortices and ironous dead networks of computers  <br />
 and the shaken huddles of players and the musters of soldiers  <br />
 at last give forth their violenet whisper. <br />
