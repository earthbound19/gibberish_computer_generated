<h1>I Have Gone Setting</h1>

<p>
 It was the sunset of the lobster.  <br />
 From her brain and her eyeballs live  <br />
 benches of bishops of the earth.  <br />
 Pockets of ash converted into emerald. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
It was the lunchtime of the lobster.  <br />
 With its putrid seize of boundless orange, spirit  <br />
 of the compendiums of books,  <br />
 deceived astronaut blood, your kisses  <br />
 reflect into exile  <br />
 and a droplet of gem, with remnants of the vicinity. <br />
