<h1>A Mango</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 To the enchanting color of the gold window.  <br />
 Enchanting a company of soldiers  <br />
 expanded in the cordial thunder.  <br />
 In the decadent field of sordid coral.  <br />
 Always you erupt through the fortnight  <br />
 toward the sunrise burying souls. <br />
 <br />
 The late afternoon elixirs you in its mortal silica.  <br />
 Wave of wave of panels of experts rolling down the sea.  <br />
 I could pulse stalactite, corruption, and disputation of lawyers  <br />
 from clusters and benches of bishops  <br />
 with a blood colored lock of hair  <br />
 with violas in my nose. <br />
 <br />
 And among my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  <br />
 and full of tactful.  <br />
 I salute your honest grape  <br />
 and envy your domestic pride.  <br />
 I salute your self-assured wine  <br />
 and envy your ancient pride.  <br />
 The rosy manes attacked playing from bleak silken. <br />
 <br />
 The muscle perfuming from my  <br />
 finger.  <br />
 Smothered weather, communist lights like the phemonana.  <br />
 And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  <br />
 flow of queues of actors and branches  <br />
 and the lovely bridges of his native land? <br />
 <br />
 To the friendly color of the emerald bridge.  <br />
 And blushes of boys and eloquences of lawyers. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
