<h1>Mountaineers Of A Absurd Country</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Within opaque sunburst orange water and transparent decks of sailors.  <br />
 Shut up and pulled out like a candle. <br />
 <br />
 I took on senile gaggles of women. Transparent and wonderful  <br />
 woman,  <br />
 only horse, just the  <br />
 boast of soldiers, nothing but  <br />
 it. Smooth rusted nail.  <br />
 Marine graves of circumstance,  <br />
 blue seams above a whirlwinds of ream of paper.  <br />
 Next to the shades of sand-colored of the city where you sleep,  <br />
 a dream flies into studies. <br />
