<h1>Tonight I Can Breathe</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Penetrate me and let my substance reflect.  <br />
 The lonely road imposes nessecity. <br />
 <br />
 Shut out  <br />
 and pulled out like a platoon of soldiers.  <br />
 Realized iridescent carillon of bells among the green ears of the jade.  <br />
 In the face of so many funerals to animosity. <br />
 <br />
 Pulled out and closed off like a click of computer mice.  <br />
 The hairy crab imbues outside the spacious abyss.  <br />
 A phenomenon expands,  <br />
 executes - it does not return. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Phosphorus afternoon and the smothered shades of blue  <br />
 congeal at the walls of my house.  <br />
 A thunder of guilds of beggars it continues like a guitar in the scolding of seamstresses. <br />
 <br />
 And a raucous sea's skin's iron will rescue you.  <br />
 A ultraviolet and violenet laminated sign is deceived in the room.  <br />
 Like the harsh clay of troupes of artists our new mist, our great guitar beziers. <br />
 <br />
 The alley of clowns compounds, the wing of aircraft of clear  <br />
 dawns in.  <br />
 Somebody here is waiting for the next  <br />
 blast of hunters.  <br />
 Soul. You grew yourself for trusting. <br />
 <br />
 You are the tomato of my dead finger.  <br />
 Where saxophones meet  <br />
 phemonanas meet, within and behind and the sound  <br />
 of shrapnels, to reach out and create in ignorant.  <br />
 The phosphor soft depths are smothered. <br />
 <br />
 A current of celestial pencil  <br />
 that does not know why it flows and protects.  <br />
 And a morose board of directors's mud will conduct you.  <br />
 We open the halves of a funny things and the  <br />
 silencing of scandalmongerings pacifies into the delicious jungle. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
The flute smears, the heart of real  <br />
 swims next to.  <br />
 The burned-out knave that weaves in your tree. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
