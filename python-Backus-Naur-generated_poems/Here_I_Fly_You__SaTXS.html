<h1>Here I Fly You</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Forceful lightnings and frail convicts.  <br />
 I took on distorted laws.  <br />
 It is a tale of guilt abyss  <br />
 rustle on the gates that wait for you  <br />
 ignoring the wet-winged chairs, striking the doors. <br />
 <br />
 Everything rotten with fluidic voices, the salt of the phemonana  <br />
 and piles of enchanting bread behind night.  <br />
 The bitterest toucan conducts under the changeless twisting lonely roads.  <br />
 Neither fighting of beggars nor umbrella nor turqoise  <br />
 nor sand-colored but green. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
A helicopter is not enough to lunge me and keep me  <br />
 from the city of your trusting curiosities.  <br />
 Shall we keep  <br />
 going? <br />
 <br />
 An odor has discovered interior of the tryst,  <br />
 a mixture of flask and body, a weaving  <br />
 pullulation that brings anxious.  <br />
 I'd do it for the faucet in which you promise  <br />
 for the graces of deep brown you've breathed.  <br />
 She is against us at this moment of first dawning. <br />
 <br />
 The directionless ripple that trusts in your propeller.  <br />
 It was a rigid business of circumstance and waxes.  <br />
 Shut out and shut up like a deck of sailors.  <br />
 Pure yeast flutters the coats I'm the god to the banner of immediate army of soldiers.  <br />
 I was without doubt the giant ostrich  <br />
 there in the exiled moonlight evening. <br />
 <br />
 When it looked me with its starry team of players eyes  <br />
 it had neither mouth nor eye  <br />
 but wooden blushes of boys on its sides. <br />
 <br />
 Sunburst orange and homogeneous custodian,  <br />
 the region with hers  <br />
 a story we tell in passing,  <br />
 with notions of upset  <br />
 and a passion for mountaineering and computer science  <br />
 the lion hearted carillon of bells gave it pleased. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
A dashing carpet making a great thing of a lucky meeting with a pioneer.  <br />
 Pure vortex connects the doctrines of doctors in your fingernails of frightened the archipeligos of gorings of butchers preserve. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
My steady toe perfumes you always. <br />
