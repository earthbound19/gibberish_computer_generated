<h1>The Cheerless Elder</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 And the bevy of beauties to its flint  <br />
 and among the choruss of angels the decisive one  <br />
 the father covered with smooth observance of hermits. Only path, just the  <br />
 poppy, nothing but  <br />
 it. Landscape. A ship is not enough to compound me and keep me  <br />
 from the city of your manly epiphany.  <br />
 Sweet-smelling, saphire propeller! <br />
