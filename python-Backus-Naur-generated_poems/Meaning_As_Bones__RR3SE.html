<h1>Meaning As Bones</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 In front of the petrifying gaggles of gossips.  <br />
 Thoughtless and gaggle of women - windows of sorrow.  <br />
 Towards those miracles of yours that wait for me.  <br />
 And hooves and promises. <br />
 <br />
 You circumscribe in the thicket as in a unguessed region.  <br />
 You blossom my fragmented cold fire  <br />
 like a noble ostrich to fresh grape.  <br />
 So the noble enthusiastic lives on in a lemon,  <br />
 the verdure house of the knave,  <br />
 the steady mist that  <br />
 is round and sanguine. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
