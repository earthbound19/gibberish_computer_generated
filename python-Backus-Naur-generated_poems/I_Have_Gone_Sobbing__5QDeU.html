<h1>I Have Gone Sobbing</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 You enchant my bitten juice  <br />
 like a musical turkey to fresh plum.  <br />
 You are the sifted daughter of a squirrel,  <br />
 the sterile ness of the lighthouse, the power of the clay. <br />
 <br />
 Interior of the parched land of phosphorus wing of aircraft.  <br />
 In the face of so many gangs of thieves to functionality. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
I do not wet in the land of communist receptacle.  <br />
 A phenomenon for calculation is the lack thereof. <br />
