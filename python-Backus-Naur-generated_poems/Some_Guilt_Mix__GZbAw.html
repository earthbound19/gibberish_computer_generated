<h1>Some Guilt Mix</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Because I love you, love, behind the sulfur and inside the gypsum.  <br />
 The rotten stump divulges on its spoiled mare  <br />
 loving silvery troops of soldiers over the thicket. <br />
 <br />
 How enchanting is the comfortable coffin and it's charitable salts?  <br />
 I stayed divulged and sand-colored  <br />
 convenient to the jungle.  <br />
 Inside the illusion of painters of the archipeligos where you sleep,  <br />
 a dream gnaws into computers.  <br />
 Only parched and to a  <br />
 uncle they take on time, thirteed years <br />
 <br />
 I want you to kiss on my chest.  <br />
 Discovered and then magnified in the field.  <br />
 Conversations of hats, the recitation  <br />
 of sun rises we call sanguine peal of bells.  <br />
 When the sea is full of disintered tail  <br />
 outside covens of witches and molested wounded essences  <br />
 and the acidulous scoops of journalists and the choruss of singers  <br />
 at last give forth their forceful noise.  <br />
 A wind of kiss not dedicating is a form of awakening. <br />
 <br />
 The deck of sailors kisses in reconciling your eyes.  <br />
 Brings all the throttles movies.  <br />
 The pioneer smiles at the person  <br />
 but the uncle does not smile  <br />
 when he looks at the toucan one  <br />
 and the decadent ocean. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
A dead point of view bristles  <br />
 even the wonderful  <br />
 minor field in phenomenon  <br />
 to which the metaphor  <br />
 will not be perched.  <br />
 Around transluscent cinnamon water and transluscent green disguisings of tailors. <br />
 <br />
