 Has the jungle been divulged with curiosities? The room in front of hers  <br />
 a telling we tell in passing,  <br />
 with notions of rational  <br />
 and a passion for science and jouranlism  <br />
 where babbles of barbers meet  <br />
 homes meet, around and inside and the sound  <br />
 of enemies, to reach out and rejoice in thoughtless. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Halfway.  <br />
 The bales of wool exists even when there is  <br />
 little to say, and it ceases  <br />
 behind it in darkness. <br />
