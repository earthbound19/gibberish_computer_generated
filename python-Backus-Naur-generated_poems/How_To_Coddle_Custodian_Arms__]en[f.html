<h1>How To Coddle Custodian Arms</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Your dove is a warmth filled with dry choir of singers.  <br />
 You see fingernails as hopeful as the thunder.  <br />
 A insufferable slate of candidates day  <br />
 how making is the great evil and it's fluidic greeds of lawyers?  <br />
 Multitude of friendships!  <br />
 In and out of the sand-colored the deep brown and the green <br />
 <br />
 And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  <br />
 attract of clicks of computer mice and folds of chairs  <br />
 and the incredulous jars of his native land?  <br />
 I do not smother in the heights of sordid imbroglio.  <br />
 Pulled out and closed off like a platoon of soldiers. <br />
 <br />
 I could set violence, darknes, and receptacle  <br />
 from choirs of singers and compendiums of books  <br />
 with a dull shades  <br />
 of sunburst orange blush of boys  <br />
 with oblivions in my fingernails.  <br />
 A chorus of oysters at morning un lighted un passed  <br />
 comes to a halt before a poppy.  <br />
 Of your blood colored mane when you hold out your hips. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
