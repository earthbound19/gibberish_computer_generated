<h1>The Spoiled Rectum</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Realized serene ream of paper a current of profound energy  <br />
 that does not know why it flows and enchants.  <br />
 Shall we proceed?  <br />
 But the form wetted the memory.  <br />
 Exciting the trouser of her sea shell full of sweet. <br />
 <br />
 You flutter uselessly into a land to flow your business.  <br />
 You are the brutal goddess of a crab,  <br />
 the inevitable ness of the board of directors, the power of the aluminum.  <br />
 A wind of escheats of lawyers I wish to make a triangle  <br />
 around, and every meaning,  <br />
 many  <br />
 times hidden in an armada of ships. <br />
 <br />
 A sunshine of hands of cards the lunchtime starlights you in its mortal clay.  <br />
 The windy bell is starry on your tail.  <br />
 To the brandishing color of the silk droplet.  <br />
 To fly lost locks of hair and for babbles of barbers. <br />
 <br />
 And outside my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked <br />
 <br />
 And full of envy.  <br />
 A shady metaphor undulates  <br />
 even  <br />
 the somber  <br />
 overtone moonlight evening in phenomenon  <br />
 to which the metaphor  <br />
 will not be built.  <br />
 I wish to make a square  <br />
 with,  <br />
 and every meaning, many  <br />
 times hidden in a bevy of beauties. <br />
 <br />
 Around marine water and crimson armies of soldiers. <br />
 <br />
 Imbue on the cadavers that wait for you  <br />
 mutating  <br />
 the spoiled chairs, abandoning the doors.  <br />
 Return to the homeland of the foliages. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Not the sand-colored moment  <br />
 when the day mingles the armies of soldiers.  <br />
 Your coat is a chorus of singers filled with morose juice. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
