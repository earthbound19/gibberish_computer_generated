<h1>From Silt To Sulfur</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 A absent minded clouds of armies of soldiers.  <br />
 If I could relax the moth and the boulevard. <br />
 <br />
 Within the cactus of the moonlight evening where you sleep,  <br />
 a dream wipes into projections.  <br />
 The I in worship of writers as soon as the incoming suns  <br />
 gives the public indication. <br />
 <br />
 To seek another land from her leg  <br />
 and her eye drink  <br />
 ripples of the earth.  <br />
 Lighting from thirsty crystal. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
