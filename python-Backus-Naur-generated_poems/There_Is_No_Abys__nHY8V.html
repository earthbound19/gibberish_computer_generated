<h1>There Is No Abys</h1> 
 <br />
 <br />
<p>
Form on the wombs that  <br />
 wait for you  <br />
 striking the neon chairs, chaining the doors.  <br />
 They crushed it with banal quilts.  <br />
 The unguessed man  <br />
 seeks in the mineral morning.  <br />
 A peal of bells focuses its dream of a beginning, its beginning, the ending of the cast of actors order -  <br />
 its indespensable utensils. <br />
 <br />
