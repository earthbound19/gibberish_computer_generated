<h1>Song For The Man Of Wet-winged Trees</h1>

<p>
 Went grew in apple neither scolding of seamstresses nor carillon of bells nor dull shades of deep brown  <br />
 nor sand-colored but sunburst orange.  <br />
 Outside the gray panicky of the seperation. From her eyeballs and her armpit inherit  <br />
 troops of soldiers of the earth. <br />
