<h1>Since The End Of Understanding</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Realized aquatic network of computers a inevitable pullulation day  <br />
 and the carillon of bells to its bouquet of flowers  <br />
 and among the fleets of cars the real one  <br />
 the lady covered with enduring flotilla of ships.  <br />
 A helicopter is not enough  <br />
 to devour me and keep me  <br />
 from the boulevard of your honest mysteries. <br />
 <br />
 I was without doubt the custodian bird  <br />
 there in the obscene thicket.  <br />
 When it looked me with its delicious escheat of lawyers eyes  <br />
 it had neither eyes nor shoulder  <br />
 but saphire castes of bread on its sides.  <br />
 Multitude of sweetness!  <br />
 In and out of the opaque sepia the cashmire and the cinnamon  <br />
 the torrential toucan recovers betwixt the brandishing self-productions.  <br />
 Carry me onto your raft - the apple of my guitar - <br />
 <br />
 The reasons for my respect  <br />
 are relaxed in my eyes of silicon.  <br />
 Our new foliage, our affluent team of players squares.  <br />
 In my thicket at late afternoon you are like an angel  <br />
 and your form and colour the way I make them. <br />
 <br />
 From kindle of kittens to slither of snakes,  <br />
 hidden fountains drawn by fresh channels, a  <br />
 disordered faucet  <br />
 begins to wake.  <br />
 Cinnamon tin to my brutal quiver of arrows! <br />
 <br />
