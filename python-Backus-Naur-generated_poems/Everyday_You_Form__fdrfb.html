 You've asked me what the bird is discovering there with his transluscent transparent leg?  <br />
 I reply, the affection knows this.  <br />
 It's a flying flint of cold fires.  <br />
 The angel deprives, the kis of unguessed  <br />
 crystallizes in.  <br />
 It seizes like a dove inside the ambush of widows. <br />
