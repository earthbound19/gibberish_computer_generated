<h1>Here I Drink You</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 The reasons for my respect  <br />
 are promised in my breast of copper.  <br />
 Multitude of tabernacles of bankers!  <br />
 In and out of the transluscent blue the sand-colored and the crimson  <br />
 your scolding of seamstresses is a blush of boys filled with boney batch of bread.  <br />
 A torrential phenomenon loiters  <br />
 even the eager  <br />
 historical universe in  <br />
 identity  <br />
 to which the metaphor  <br />
 will not be breathed. <br />
 <br />
 Our new shoreline, our decisive smooth iron tetrahedrons.  <br />
 Because I love you, love, in front of the stone and outside the wind.  <br />
 To the homogeneous human souffle of clouds it is a tale of thirsty evils apex of the thicket like salt. <br />
