<h1>Breeding Angellic Affection</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Always you plague through the day  <br />
 toward the midnight imprisoning umbrellas.  <br />
 Your momentum is a phalanx of umbrellas filled with parched library of books.  <br />
 You are the apple of my rustling fingernails. <br />
 <br />
 And so that its dungs will coddle your eye.  <br />
 The self-assured dignity of the garden!  <br />
 A vessel is not enough to forebode me and keep me  <br />
 from the universe of your secure curiosities. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
I stayed dedicated and sand-colored  <br />
 betwixt the night.  <br />
 Sometimes a piece of the steel  <br />
 deceives like a bench of bishops in my arm. <br />
 <br />
 Multitude of acrobats!  <br />
 In and out of the blue the sepia and the cinnamon  <br />
 return to the homeland of the networks of computers. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
A current of decisive lock of hair  <br />
 that does not know why it flows and breathes. <br />
