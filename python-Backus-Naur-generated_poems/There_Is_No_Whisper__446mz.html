 We get the sight  <br />
 they must lots to crystallize  <br />
 to each other  <br />
 or perhaps nothing but alarms.  <br />
 Perhaps they are not punctured.  <br />
 Changeless empire. The tetrahedron functions to promise an architecture  <br />
 to its architecture.  <br />
 You see toe as mineral as the wind.  <br />
 And so that its holes will abduct your mouth. <br />
 <br />
 You've asked me what the toucan is  <br />
 mixing there with his transparent ears?  <br />
 I reply, the cactus knows this.  <br />
 The shrapnel mixes on its careless mare  <br />
 enchanting marine splendors over the thicket. <br />
 <br />
 You - the plumed ears. <br />
