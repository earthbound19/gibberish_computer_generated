<h1>A Natural Substance</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 A sun of pads of paper if you were not the orange the warm moon  <br />
 cooks, sprinkling its orange across the sea.  <br />
 Not awakening is a form of showering. <br />
 <br />
 You are the fractious gentleman of a lobster,  <br />
 the dead ness of the smooth foam, the power of the sky. <br />
 <br />
 I stayed fluttered and transluscent burnt umber  <br />
 exterior of the universe. <br />
 <br />
 The sun plan that has everyone neon.  <br />
 Cold weather, sterile lights like the posse of police. <br />
