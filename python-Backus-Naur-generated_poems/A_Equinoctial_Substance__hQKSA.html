<h1>A Equinoctial Substance</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 The reasons for my respect  <br />
 are divulged in my eyeballs of ivory.  <br />
 Brings all the punctures lands.  <br />
 Pockets of rusted nail converted into marble.  <br />
 A senile sequence twists  <br />
 even the eager  <br />
 neutral moonlight evening in detail  <br />
 to which the metaphor  <br />
 will not be trusted. <br />
 <br />
 And inside my hammock, during the lunchtime, I woke up naked  <br />
 and full of tactful.  <br />
 The pure prize gave it kindness. <br />
