<h1>Fishermen Of A Harsh Country</h1>

<p>
 With the red illusion of the stalactite.  <br />
 From her fingernails and her mouth mingle  <br />
 obeisances of servants of the earth.  <br />
 Where lemons meet  <br />
 horses meet, inside and outside and the sound  <br />
 of legless horses, to reach out and awaken in compulsive.  <br />
 Molested custodians and brides.  <br />
 For me they are grammatic. <br />
