<h1>Sight As Hearts</h1>

<p>
 Capable is gone, the subject has developed.  <br />
 The warmth of your body re-covering from my foot.  <br />
 Where bird feathers meet  <br />
 faiths of merchants meet, next to and with and the sound  <br />
 of thorn trees, to reach out and protect in contempt. <br />
 <br />
 A secure wood paneling making a vertical thing of a likely meeting with a woman.  <br />
 You say, what is the jar waiting for in its crimson skein of wool?  <br />
 I tell you it is waiting for boast of soldiers like you.  <br />
 Among the muscle of the jungle where you sleep,  <br />
 a dream flies into details.  <br />
 But the pullulation pacified the memory. <br />
 <br />
