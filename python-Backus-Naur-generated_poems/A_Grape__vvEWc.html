 Bale of wool was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  <br />
 Nothing but your starry foot.  <br />
 Always you execute through the afternoon  <br />
 toward the holiday decaying telegraphs.  <br />
 But I should be true to science, deceiving among its ghostly bevies of girls  <br />
 so let us try to divulge a story without technical redundancies. <br />
 <br />
 I salute your perfect lemon  <br />
 and envy your verdure pride.  <br />
 You say, what is the cactus waiting for in its blue jar?  <br />
 I tell you it is waiting for pack of cards like you. <br />

 Sunburst  <br />
