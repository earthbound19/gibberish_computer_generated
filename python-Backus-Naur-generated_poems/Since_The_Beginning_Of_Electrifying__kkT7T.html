<h1>Since The Beginning Of Electrifying</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 What absorbant hearts -  <br />
 the sea is filled with it,  <br />
 manes for the thought of barons and the tear stained cork.  <br />
 In the sunburst orange lip of the earth.  <br />
 When you expand like gaggle of women heard by the lava.  <br />
 Not to rescue or even meet  <br />
 the stalks of cattail of one who trusts  <br />
 perpendicular to me in a modern office or galloping to a pioneer. <br />
 <br />
 I stayed crystallized and sunburst  <br />
 orange  <br />
 parrallel to the sea.  <br />
 There are no bloods but hated cycles of flight of angels and sunburst orange  <br />
 platoons of soldiers of acerb tear stained clay.  <br />
 Indicates the sea's skin's relaxing hips. <br />
 <br />
