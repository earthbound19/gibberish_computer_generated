<h1>Metaphor Exclusive Of The Salt</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 The modern office within hers  <br />
 a tale we tell in passing,  <br />
 with notions of compassion  <br />
 and a passion for computer science and oceanography  <br />
 here I am, a irreducable breath abolished in the region of laminated sign.  <br />
 With its disintered store you say, what is the sphere waiting for in its cashmire mosaic?  <br />
 I tell you it is waiting for miracle like you.  <br />
 Draw from it the cold  <br />
 image of its own detail. <br />
 <br />
 An odor has chirped adjacent to the souffle of clouds,  <br />
 a mixture of depth and body, an attracting  <br />
 congregation of people that brings malevolent. <br />
 <br />
 In the smallest crystal wave here I am, a poetic loins replaced in the field of ritual.  <br />
 In your foot of shattering the modern office begins to dream of transforming. <br />
