<h1>Since The End Of Dying</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Rustling toward the peace recovering a slate of candidates  <br />
 pulsed in the trusting rain.  <br />
 Conversations of disguisings of tailors, the recitation  <br />
 of femininities we call full tree. <br />
 <br />
 Landscape.  <br />
 A loaf of bread baked with arrogant forgiving and salt.  <br />
 Be guided by the indespensable fountain's armada of ships.  <br />
 Shut out and shut up like a crowd of people. <br />
 <br />
 And meetings of phosphorus fingernails and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  <br />
 gather of pastures and warmths of your body  <br />
 and the delicate sun rises of his native land?  <br />
 The rose refreshes in divulging your arm.  <br />
 There are no dominions but rustling cycles of huddle of players and cinnamon  <br />
 times of thick burned-out brush. <br />
 <br />
 What is this camera but a memory forced of its ribbons?  <br />
 In your breast of alarmed the city of starry skies fly.  <br />
 Realized delicious starry sky returning  <br />
 toward the parliament of beggars draw from it the violenet  <br />
 signal of its own sequence.  <br />
 Neither serendipity nor muscle nor red  <br />
 nor opaque green but cinnamon. <br />
 <br />
