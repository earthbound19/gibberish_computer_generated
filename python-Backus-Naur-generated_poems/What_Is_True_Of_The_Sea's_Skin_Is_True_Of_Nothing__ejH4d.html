<h1>What Is True Of The Sea's Skin Is True Of Nothing</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 No one here is waiting for the next ritual.  <br />
 Board of directors. You woke yourself for blossoming.  <br />
 Pockets of aluminum converted into cedar. <br />
 <br />
 Behind the rusted night of inaccessible fragrance of strawberry.  <br />
 A machine for sequence is the lack thereof. <br />
 <br />
 In your mouth of lunging  <br />
 the boulevard  <br />
 begins to dream of seeking. <br />
