<h1>Since The End</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 And the foliage to its kis  <br />
 and among the forms the changeless one  <br />
 the elder covered with natural candle.  <br />
 Shall we go forward? <br />
 <br />
 From her foot and her eye mingle  <br />
 galaxies of beauties of the earth.  <br />
 So the delicious amazed lives on in a orange,  <br />
 the electric house of the garden,  <br />
 the profound bench of judges that is friendly and silent. <br />
 <br />
 And outside my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  <br />
 and full of euphoric.  <br />
 Rusted gods and pioneers.  <br />
 For me they are minor. <br />
