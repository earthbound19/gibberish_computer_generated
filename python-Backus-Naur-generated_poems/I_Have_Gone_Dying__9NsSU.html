<h1>I Have Gone Dying</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 You, who is like an ash lobster among the entertaining of many son.  <br />
 What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  <br />
 Realized mineral mane but I  <br />
 should be betrays the nature of jouranlism, bristling among its troubled mists  <br />
 so let us try to tell a story devoid of grammatic redundancies. <br />
 <br />
 I trust as if outside a fractious vortex.  <br />
 A triangle among a square,  <br />
 the shifty workings of cordial law.  <br />
 The cast of actors punctures, the crew of sailors of indespensable  <br />
 lives next  <br />
 to.  <br />
 The reasons for my respect  <br />
 are wetted in my hand of ivory.  <br />
 Vulnerable is gone, the subject has wetted. <br />
 <br />
 It inherits like a fellowship inside the anthology of poems.  <br />
 Around the city I like to trust like a bitten planetarium.  <br />
 There are many pamphlets in front of wet-winged events. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
As if to silence or understand or steal.  <br />
 Carrying from rigid ivory. <br />
 <br />
 Full stop.  <br />
 Your muscle is an abominable sight of monks filled with shady quiver.  <br />
 In my modern office at day you are like a femininity  <br />
 and your form and colour the way I magnify them.  <br />
 A image lives,  <br />
 abandons - it does not return. <br />
 <br />
 A lethargic synonym brainwashes  <br />
 even the pure  <br />
 neutral field in sequence  <br />
 to which the metaphor  <br />
 will not be trod.  <br />
 Misunderstood early light of day and the nauesous crowd of people  <br />
 pity at the walls of my house.  <br />
 What seems disjoint to one will not  <br />
 seem so to another. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
You say, what is the angel waiting for in its sunburst orange phalanx of umbrellas?  <br />
 I tell you it is waiting for illusion of magicians like you.  <br />
 Shall we set forth?  <br />
 It was the day of the oyster.  <br />
 Like shardss of crystal taunting within skeins of wool.  <br />
 As soon as the incoming retinues of players  <br />
 gives the technical indication. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
It was the lunchtime of the turkey.  <br />
 You, who is like a salt pheasant among the dedicating of many one. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
</p>
