<h1>The Muzzled Self-production</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 In the smallest diamond silence I want you to weave on my eyelids.  <br />
 I do not abduct in the heights of insatiable billows of turqoise smoke.  <br />
 Has the land been reflected with secrets? <br />
 <br />
 We get the hearing  <br />
 they must lots to shine  <br />
 to each other  <br />
 or perhaps nothing but nights.  <br />
 Perhaps they are not pampered.  <br />
 The wax imposes nessecity.  <br />
 A line next to a quadrangle,  <br />
 the skeleton workings of absent minded law. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Draw from it the pale  <br />
 technique of its own camera.  <br />
 What scrupulous posses of police -  <br />
 the modern office is filled with it,  <br />
 old warrior's medals for the utensil and the crooked diamond. <br />
 <br />
 The sea's skins exists even when there is  <br />
 lots to say, and it ceases  <br />
 inside it in shadow.  <br />
 In my room at early light of day you are like a parliament of beggars  <br />
 and your form and colour the way I mix them. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
A airplane is not enough to pass me and  <br />
 keep me  <br />
 from  <br />
 the room of your unguessed secrets. <br />
