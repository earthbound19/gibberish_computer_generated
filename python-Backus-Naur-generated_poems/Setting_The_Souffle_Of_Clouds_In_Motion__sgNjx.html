<h1>Setting The Souffle Of Clouds In Motion</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Transluscent opaque cashmire vagabonds of uranu,  <br />
 opaque transparent seams above a sordid pullulation.  <br />
 What naked fightings of beggars -  <br />
 the divisions is filled with it,  <br />
 precisions for the poppy and the sticky fused quartz.  <br />
 Only lashed and to a  <br />
 god they take on time, unnumbered years <br />
 <br />
 Always you faint through the night  <br />
 toward the day filtering sea water.  <br />
 And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  <br />
 flutter of guilds of beggars  <br />
 and wings of aircraft  <br />
 and the homogeneous choruss of angels of his native land?  <br />
 Your mist is a bevy of ladies filled with hollow alley of clowns. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
I am pampered by observance of hermits and abys, by billows of opaque opaque dark smoke and fog.  <br />
 You are going to ask where are the fill?  <br />
 And the promising parliaments of beggars?  <br />
 And the clouds iridescent splattering its films and wetting them full of  <br />
 universe and lobster? <br />
 <br />
 The poetic flesh gave it truthful.  <br />
 But the disguising of tailors connected the memory.  <br />
 From her eyelids and her tail respond  <br />
 essences of the earth. <br />
 <br />
 Because I love you, love, within the phosphor and around the electricity.  <br />
 Your tail stands from south to south  <br />
 sometimes a piece of the silica  <br />
 strikes like a miracle in my curves. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Realized absent minded parliament of beggars indicates the atom's perching mouth.  <br />
 A solute wind of quivers of arrows. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
What homogeneous retinues of players -  <br />
 the room is filled with it,  <br />
 corals for the armada of ships and the disordered glass.  <br />
 When the thicket is full of lonely mouth  <br />
 among waxes and bitter dead pencils  <br />
 and the spoiled troupes of dancers and the choruss of angels  <br />
 at last give forth their blood-stained cummerbund. <br />
 <br />
