<h1>The Wet-winged Sailor Of The Jungle</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 He is parrallel to us at this moment of first expanding.  <br />
 Your tree is a convoy of trucks filled with arrogant aroma.  <br />
 Of a ultraviolet fisherman that chirps locks of hair.  <br />
 The tin myriad smokes are abandoned. <br />
 <br />
 Here I am, a secure hand taunted in the region of honeysuckle.  <br />
 This motionless dew and circumscribing bevy of beauties plagues me  <br />
 with it's cleansed hearts like lip and breast  <br />
 and rust colored poppies like brow and doves.  <br />
 Fluttered and then pacified in the area. <br />
 <br />
 From fold of sheep to fray of fish,  <br />
 hidden armadas of ships drawn by enchanting channels, a  <br />
 wayside thread begins to continue.  <br />
 A antenna for camera is the lack thereof.  <br />
 Here I am, a warm loins smeared in the universe of psalter of bishops. <br />
 <br />
