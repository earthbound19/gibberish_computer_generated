<h1>The Sticky Stalactite</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 From her armpit and her shoulder crystallize  <br />
 bridges of the earth.  <br />
 She is about us at this moment of first mingling. <br />
 <br />
 Come with me to the conspirator of salts.  <br />
 Full stop.  <br />
 On what raucous enemies dawned with fire?  <br />
 I'm the uncle to the breakfast of immediate farm. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
The night within hers  <br />
 a tradition we speak in passing,  <br />
 with notions of grateful  <br />
 and a passion for photography and mountaineering <br />
