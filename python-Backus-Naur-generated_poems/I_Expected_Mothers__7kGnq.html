<h1>I Expected Mothers</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 A boat is not enough to invade me and keep me  <br />
 from the city of your comfortable funny things.  <br />
 A cashmire movie showers.  <br />
 Your mist is a wreath filled with thirsty candle.  <br />
 Carry me onto your wheel - the apple of my serenity - <br />
 <br />
 A chorus of tigers at twilight un lighted un compounded  <br />
 comes to a halt before a company of soldiers.  <br />
 A phenomenon creates,  <br />
 soddens - it does not return.  <br />
 The midnight love you in its mortal ruby. <br />
 <br />
 And so that its gangs of thieves will puncture your toe.  <br />
 Conversations of houses of senators, the recitation  <br />
 of starlights we call vertical change of bells.  <br />
 In the smallest marble soul one of them is stationary,  <br />
 the other knows identities.  <br />
 Where is someone  <br />
 she says, and when can we see what  <br />
 is going to happen?  <br />
 Pockets of graphite converted into silk. <br />
 <br />
 In the coddling legless horses.  <br />
 Conversations of fleets of cars, the recitation  <br />
 of perfumes we call pure defender. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
