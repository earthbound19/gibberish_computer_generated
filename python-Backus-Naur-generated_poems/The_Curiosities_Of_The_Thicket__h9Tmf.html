<h1>The Curiosities Of The Thicket</h1>

<p>
 Parrallel to the heights like brick.  <br />
 Around the fleet of cars of the field where you sleep,  <br />
 a dream faints into studies.  <br />
 Of a rust colored giant that crystallizes quivers of arrows.  <br />
 We open the halves of a epiphany and the  <br />
 hating of gaggles of gossips creates into the somber field. <br />
