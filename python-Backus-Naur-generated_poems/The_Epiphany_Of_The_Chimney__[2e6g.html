<h1>The Epiphany Of The Chimney</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 I could blossom rectum, coffin, and convict  <br />
 from times and friendships  <br />
 with a dark rascal of boys  <br />
 with bombs in my loins.  <br />
 It is a tale of insufferable skulks of thieves has the boulevard been heard with mysteries?  <br />
 Everything dead with infinite voices, the salt of the sea water  <br />
 and piles of nocturnal bread in front of afternoon.  <br />
 Bed of a flew shaken company of actors. <br />
 <br />
 Come with me to the unction of undertakers of havocs.  <br />
 You've asked me what the cat is breathing there with his cinnamon  <br />
 brain? <br />
 <br />
 I reply, the chorus of singers knows this.  <br />
 The one smiles at the giant  <br />
 but the pioneer does  <br />
 not smile  <br />
 when he  <br />
 looks at the elephant mountaineer  <br />
 and the senile ocean. <br />
