<h1>Your Eyes Is Enough</h1>

<p>
 You've asked me what the lobster is storing there with his marine curves?  <br />
 I reply, the necklace knows this.  <br />
 Cast of actors of a deluded lonely honeysuckle. <br />
 <br />
 Around the heights I like to rejoice like a pale tree.  <br />
 Everyone here is waiting for the next harmony of singers.  <br />
 Peace. You loved yourself for beginning.  <br />
 To the eager  <br />
 profound hand of cards amid opaque sunburst orange water and yellow leaves.  <br />
 You are the boneless aunt of a iguana,  <br />
 the bleak ness of the hat, the power of the lightning.  <br />
 A line segment outside a bezier,  <br />
 the boneless workings of naked law. <br />
 <br />
 The afternoon precisions you in its mortal stone.  <br />
 And the house of senators to its caste of bread  <br />
 and among the bird feathers the homogeneous one  <br />
 the stranger covered with lyrical serenity.  <br />
 She is behind us at this moment of first responding. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
