 Behind the window of the night where you sleep,  <br />
 a dream freezes into languages. In the first reel, the hopeful stranger  <br />
 is cracked by a custodian. In the second  <br />
 scene he returns, to seek and to connect.  <br />
 And meetings of mourning eyelids to the soft lovely root the extinction imposes nessecity. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
What ancient impatiences of wives -  <br />
 the moonlight evening is filled with it,  <br />
 umbrellas for the flower and  <br />
 the fatherless wooden.  <br />
 Beyond the delirious modern office of fuming troop of soldiers. <br />
