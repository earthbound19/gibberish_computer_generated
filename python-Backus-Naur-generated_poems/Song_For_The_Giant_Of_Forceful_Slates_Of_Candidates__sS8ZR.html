<h1>Song For The Giant Of Forceful Slates Of Candidates</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 The starlights exists even when there is  <br />
 little to say, and it ceases  <br />
 around  <br />
 it in shadow.  <br />
 Like rusted echo, baptisms of water  <br />
 among sepia water and burnt umber convoys of trucks.  <br />
 To the promising color of the diamond peal of bells.  <br />
 You, who is like a oblivion lobster among the flowing of many daughter. <br />
 <br />
 Like smothered babble of barbers, coats  <br />
 we open the halves of a mysteries and the  <br />
 chaining of bloodied broken glasses lights into the poetic modern office.  <br />
 And you prosecuted in the demeaned and enchanted a overflowing noise.  <br />
 The molested mosaic is sanguine on your shoulder. <br />
 <br />
