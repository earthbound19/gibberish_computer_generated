 Good is gone, the subject has understood.  <br />
 In my room at fortnight you are like a dew  <br />
 and your form and colour the way I kiss them.  <br />
 There are many trapdoors behind demonic events.  <br />
 What we say stands to  <br />
 trust some other mother  <br />
 what a signal may teach. <br />
