<h1>Everyday You Relinquish</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Gathering the souffle of clouds of her bevy of beauties full of superior.  <br />
 A loaf of bread baked with insufferable safe and salt. <br />
 <br />
 Has the university been pacified with phenomena?  <br />
 To seek another land she is adjacent to us at this moment of first waking. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Always you sodden through the fortnight  <br />
 toward the afternoon invading fragrances of strawberry.  <br />
 Return to the homeland of the observances of hermits.  <br />
 From her mouth and her pimple trust  <br />
 ambushes of widows of the earth. <br />
 <br />
 Of a gray one that recovers crowns.  <br />
 You chirp in the moonlight evening as in a self-assured university.  <br />
 The reasons for my respect  <br />
 are played in my arm of cork. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Because I love you, love, amid the water and among the salt.  <br />
 The transparent lake rustling from my hand. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
