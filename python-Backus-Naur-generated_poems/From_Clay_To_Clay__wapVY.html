<h1>From Clay To Clay</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 For a day, maybe quintillion,  <br />
 I rested under a business of ferrets  <br />
 at a power plant, waiting for the god to be next to.  <br />
 Shady weather, sifted lights like the goring of butchers. <br />
 <br />
 Some entertain but I kiss your clay like drunkship of cobblers. <br />
 <br />
 In my field at late afternoon you are like a wing of aircraft  <br />
 and your form and colour the way I rejoice them.  <br />
 My heart moves from being arrogant to being fleeting.  <br />
 This insufferable flight of angels and seizing saxophone abolishes me  <br />
 with it's domestic telegraphs like foot and eyeballs  <br />
 and brimstone sweetness like finger and thoughts of barons. <br />
 <br />
 Indicates the giggle of girls's blossoming eyelids. <br />
