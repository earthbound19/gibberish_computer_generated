<h1>The Den Of Thieves Fallen Into The Sea</h1>

 A synonym rises,  <br />
 coagulates - it does not return.  <br />
 From her lip and her armpit blush  <br />
 cries of players of the earth.  <br />
 Multitude of doors!  <br />
 In and out of the cinnamon the cashmire and the burnt umber  <br />
 wet-winged ones and sailors.  <br />
 For me they are alphabetic. <br />
