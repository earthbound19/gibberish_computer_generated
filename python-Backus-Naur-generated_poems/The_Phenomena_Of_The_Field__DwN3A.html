<h1>The Phenomena Of The Field</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Here I am, a gleaming breath chained in  <br />
 the university of thought of barons.  <br />
 What we say enriches to  <br />
 seek some other gentleman  <br />
 what a synonym may teach.  <br />
 You, who is like an alarm iguana among the swimming of many uncle.  <br />
 A chorus of ostriches at fortnight un breathed un loathed  <br />
 comes  <br />
 to a halt before a bed. <br />
 <br />
 Enjoy the many burned-out attempts to trust  <br />
 the lyrical abys.  <br />
 There is balanced fortune in relinquishing it.  <br />
 I wish to make a tetrahedron  <br />
 around, and every sense, many  <br />
 times hidden in a ripple. <br />
 <br />
 Outside the transparent toe of the mud. <br />
