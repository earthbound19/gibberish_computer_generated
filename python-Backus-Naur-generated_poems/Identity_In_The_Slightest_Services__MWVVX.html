 A black and harsh bird feather is overflowed in the chimney. I was without doubt the god pheasant  <br />
 there in the melancholy field.  <br />
 When it looked me with its gleaming bench of bishops eyes  <br />
 it had neither hips nor brow  <br />
 but ceramic roses on its sides. Like banal goring of butchers, networks of computers  <br />
 this rusted defender and expanding nature shatters me  <br />
 with it's ancient platoons of soldiers like leg and armpit  <br />
 and dull shades of blue reflections like brain and cathedrals.  <br />
 Cinnamon throats of blood,  <br />
 sunburst orange seams above a fatherless warmth. <br />
