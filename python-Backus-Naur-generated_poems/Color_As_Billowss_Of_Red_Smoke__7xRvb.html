<p>
 Scratch me and let my substance understand. A fog of currents brings all the shakes corals.  <br />
 But I should be affinitive to engineering, smothering among its molested giggles of girls  <br />
 so let us seek to divulge a story without side redundancies. <br />
 <br />
 For femininity was fractious and morally neutral.  <br />
 Neither prize nor sea water nor brimstone  <br />
 nor cashmire but sand-colored. <br />
