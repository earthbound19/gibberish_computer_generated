<p>
 For a day, maybe eight,  <br />
 I rested under a descent of woodpeckers  <br />
 at a power plant, waiting for the god to be behind.  <br />
 You inherit wearily into a modern office to begin your business. <br />
 <br />
 Not to divulge or even meet  <br />
 the library of books of one who seizes  <br />
 surpassing me in a city or drinking to a elder.  <br />
 Indicates the disguising of tailors's mingling fingernails. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
What we say stores to  <br />
 reflect some other man  <br />
 what a production may teach.  <br />
 And you congealed in the uncivil and created a bristling ego. <br />
