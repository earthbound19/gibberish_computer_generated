<h1>I Have Gone Gnawing</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 My homogeneous brow perfumes you always.  <br />
 They dismantled it with lewd packs of cards.  <br />
 I took on fatherless houses of senators. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Melancholy weather, inaccessible lights like the promise.  <br />
 The acerb dignity of the gaggle of women!  <br />
 And the lock of hair to its honeysuckle  <br />
 and among the hooves the somber one  <br />
 the man covered with resplendent springtime. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Loathe me and let my substance swim.  <br />
 Dead sunset and the hollow essence  <br />
 coagulate at the walls of my house. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
