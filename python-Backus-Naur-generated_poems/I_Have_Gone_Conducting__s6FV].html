<h1>I Have Gone Conducting</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 A blood colored and  <br />
 fractious cry of actors is silenced  <br />
 in the area.  <br />
 You expand in the city as in a gleaming region.  <br />
 Sometimes a piece of the obsidian  <br />
 prosecutes like an alley of clowns in my brow. <br />
 <br />
 He is among us at this moment of first entertaining.  <br />
 Beyond the rotten poppy, many shady torrents.  <br />
 We open the halves of a funny things and the  <br />
 dying of scandalmongerings gathers into the sanguine sea.  <br />
 Neither bridge nor caste of bread nor ultraviolet  <br />
 nor burnt umber but sunburst orange.  <br />
 Wave of wave of locks of hair rolling down the sea. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Not the transluscent blue moment  <br />
 when the morning makes the forests.  <br />
 A cinnamon bouquet of flowers connects. <br />
 <br />
 Pockets of graphite converted into ceramic. To seek another land for a day, maybe uncounted,  <br />
 I rested under a kaleidoscope of butterflies  <br />
 at a convenience store, waiting for the lady to be in front of.  <br />
 Brings all the coagulates tigers.  <br />
 You've asked me what the turkey is kissing there with his burnt umber nose?  <br />
 I reply, the droplet  <br />
 knows this.  <br />
 Always you abandon through the early light of day  <br />
 toward the early light of day protesting huddles of players. <br />
 <br />
 Always you steal through the day <br />
 <br />
 Toward the fortnight imprisoning flocks of tourists.  <br />
 Malevolent and brigade of soldiers - tigers of wicked.  <br />
 Be guided by the warm mist's jar. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
