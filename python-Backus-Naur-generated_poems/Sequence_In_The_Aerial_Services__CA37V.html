 I'm the one to the saxophone of immediate essence.  <br />
 If I could fly the massacre and the land.  <br />
 Only mourning and to a  <br />
 son they take on time, few years  <br />
 a rambunctious computer conquers  <br />
 even the natural  <br />
 algorithmic thicket in projection  <br />
 to which the metaphor  <br />
 will not be set. <br />
