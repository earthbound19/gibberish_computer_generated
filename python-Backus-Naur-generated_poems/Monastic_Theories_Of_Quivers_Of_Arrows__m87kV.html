 You, who is like a trap lobster among the exciting of many stranger.  <br />
 What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another. <br />
 <br />
 Come with me to the granule of phlegms.  <br />
 What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
In my city at night you are like a mist  <br />
 and your form and colour the way I excite them.  <br />
 A burnt umber faucet refreshes. <br />
