 I was without doubt the cousin cat  <br />
 there in the frail jungle.  <br />
 When it looked me with its human flower head eyes  <br />
 it had neither armpit nor shoulder  <br />
 but cedar disguisings of tailors on its sides.  <br />
 A current of dashing root  <br />
 that does not know why it flows and protects.  <br />
 I stayed continued and transparent  <br />
 among the land.  <br />
 Be guided by the hidden stalks of cattail's grace. <br />
