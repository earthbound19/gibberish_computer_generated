<h1>There Is No Lonely Road</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 I am cracked by change of bells and juice, by stalactite and sun.  <br />
 The fresh dignity of the wing of aircraft!  <br />
 The sea among hers  <br />
 a hearsay we speak in passing,  <br />
 with notions of accommodating  <br />
 and a passion for oceanography and engineering  <br />
 on what nauesous moths relinquished with lava? <br />
 <br />
 Closed off and pulled out like a elixir.  <br />
 In the first take, the charitable stranger  <br />
 is abolished by a woman. In the second  <br />
 take he returns, to form and to excite.  <br />
 Your mouth treads from south to north <br />
 <br />
 Browbeaten night and the clenched stars in the sky  <br />
 erupt at the walls of my house.  <br />
 In my archipeligos at midnight you are like a lighthouse  <br />
 and your form and colour the way I weave them. <br />
 <br />
 You are the blood-stained one of a turkey,  <br />
 the fatherless ness of the school of clerks, the power of the jade.  <br />
 What electrical bales of wool -  <br />
 the universe is filled with it,  <br />
 pinheads of angels for the bed and the barbaous gem. <br />
 <br />
