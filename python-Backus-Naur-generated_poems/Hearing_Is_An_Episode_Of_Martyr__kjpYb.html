<h1>Hearing Is An Episode Of Martyr</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 As soon as the incoming wells  <br />
 gives the grammatic indication.  <br />
 Force me and let my substance gather. <br />
 <br />
 Promising the aspen of her smooth broken glass full of wonderful.  <br />
 Which is a full escheat of lawyers of directions  <br />
 twenty-seven or fifteen, perfumed  <br />
 on a troupe of dancers or in the delicate queue of actors  <br />
 directions of the toe, a calculation in your eyes.  <br />
 Inside the sun of the boulevard where you sleep,  <br />
 a dream deprives into computers.  <br />
 If I could form the consequence and the sea. <br />
 <br />
 Storing the warmth of her bell full of knowledge.  <br />
 Because I love you, love, in front of the clay and with the wind.  <br />
 But the starry sky relaxed the memory. <br />
 <br />
 I'm the woman to the ripple of immediate fleet of ships.  <br />
 When the boulevard is full of torrential mouth  <br />
 in front of receptacles and torrential rotten doves  <br />
 and the shaken phalanxes of umbrellas and the bales of wool  <br />
 at last give forth their calculating howl.  <br />
 You are the neurotic mother of a bird,  <br />
 the shady ness of the book, the power of the plasma. <br />
 <br />
 For a day, maybe six,  <br />
 I rested under a drift of pigs  <br />
 at a convenience store, waiting for the gentleman to be next to.  <br />
 A breath and a fingernails  <br />
 responding the divisions.  <br />
 Neither cry of actors nor glaze of tourists nor dark  <br />
 nor yellow but marine.  <br />
 When you play like bottle recovered by the ruby. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
