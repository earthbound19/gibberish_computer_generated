<h1>It Understood With Cathedrals</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Fleet of cars.  <br />
 A land focuses its dream of a new beginning, its beginning, the ever pausing of the well order -  <br />
 its fluidic probes. <br />
 <br />
 Someone here is waiting for the next  <br />
 sun.  <br />
 Lock of hair. You crystallized yourself for crystallizing.  <br />
 Setting a current  <br />
 upgraded in the verdure sun. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
And so that its belts will dismantle your shoulder.  <br />
 Our new quiver of arrows, our slender map line segments. <br />
