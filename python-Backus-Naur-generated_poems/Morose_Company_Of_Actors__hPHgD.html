 You - the naked hand.  <br />
 A wind of muscles and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  <br />
 weave of thoughts of barons and doctrines of doctors  <br />
 and the round armadas of ships of his native land?  <br />
 Which is a great bench of bishops of directions  <br />
 sixteen or thousand, relaxed  <br />
 on a choir of singers or  <br />
 in the vertical planetarium  <br />
 directions of the breast, a calculation in your hearts.  <br />
 A production for  <br />
 metaphor is  <br />
 the lack thereof. <br />
 <br />
 What drowns the props of capable?  <br />
 You - the careful fingernails.  <br />
 Of human orange, spirit  <br />
 of the babbles of barbers,  <br />
 fainted daughter blood, your kisses  <br />
 preserve into exile  <br />
 and a droplet  <br />
 of crystal, with remnants of the night. <br />
 <br />
 Not rescuing is  <br />
 a form of dedicating.  <br />
 The motionless sea of bishops that dedicates in your droplet.  <br />
 What is this phenomenon but a memory mourned of its damnings of jurors?  <br />
 It was the sunset of the cat.  <br />
 For a day, maybe uncounted,  <br />
 I rested under a generation of vipers  <br />
 at a processing plant, waiting for the lady to be within.  <br />
 Once there was an arrogant uncle who  <br />
 stood at parties, sitting in a triangle, among huddles of lawyers. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
It was the twilight of the crab.  <br />
 And the deck of sailors to its essence  <br />
 and among the obeisances of servants the friendly one  <br />
 the gentleman covered with absent minded troupe  <br />
 of acrobats. <br />
 <br />
