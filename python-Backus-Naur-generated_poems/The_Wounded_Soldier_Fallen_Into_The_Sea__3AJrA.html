<h1>The Wounded Soldier Fallen Into The Sea</h1>

<p>
 You fly my smothered panic  <br />
 like a fluidic crab to fresh nectarine. I stayed recovered and opaque blue  <br />
 among the chimney.  <br />
 Which is a monastic time of directions  <br />
 innumerable or innumerable,  <br />
 fashioned  <br />
 on a library of books or in the angellic disguising of tailors  <br />
 directions of the toe, a calculation in your mouths. <br />
