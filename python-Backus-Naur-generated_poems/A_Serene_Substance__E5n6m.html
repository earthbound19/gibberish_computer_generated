<h1>A Serene Substance</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 The I in magnolium you say, what is the eloquence of lawyers waiting for in its green trouser?  <br />
 I tell you it is waiting for doctrine of doctors like you.  <br />
 A bicycle  <br />
 is not enough to kill me and keep me  <br />
 from the city of your affluent epiphany. <br />
 <br />
 Towards those moons of yours that wait for me.  <br />
 Return to the homeland of the sea shells. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
A free sunshine of fleets of cars.  <br />
 Everything insatiable with esoteric voices, the salt of the skein of wool  <br />
 and piles of romantic bread behind early light of day. <br />
