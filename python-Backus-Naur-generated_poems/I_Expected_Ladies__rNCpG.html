<h1>I Expected Ladies</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 I could travel enemy, vinegar, and lard  <br />
 from posses of police and troops of soldiers  <br />
 with a brimstone poppy  <br />
 with conspirators in my shoulder.  <br />
 Mingling toward the shades of burnt umber it is a tale of oily wombs everything demonic with honest voices, the salt of the host of angels  <br />
 and piles of perfect bread in front of morning. <br />
 <br />
 In my region at sunrise you are like a flock of tourists  <br />
 and your form and colour the way I swim them.  <br />
 Only violenet and to a  <br />
 sailor they take on time, numberless years <br />
 <br />
 Neither bevy of ladies nor peal of bells nor dark  <br />
 nor silvery but opaque burnt umber. <br />
