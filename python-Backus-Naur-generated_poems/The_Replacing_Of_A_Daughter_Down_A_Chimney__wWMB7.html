<h1>The Replacing Of A Daughter Down A Chimney</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 The communist autumn is thick on your chest. The lethargic goblet is fleeting on your mouth. <br />
 <br />
 Here I am, a pure ears bristled in the field of foam. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
What drops the props of idealistic?  <br />
 But I should be polar opposite of science, chaining among its rusted tigers  <br />
 so let us endeavour to divulge a story without overtone redundancies.  <br />
 A lake -like whisper  <br />
 carry me onto your raft - the kiwi of my ribbon -.  <br />
 Opaque opaque opaque cinnamon and steady person, <br />
 <br />
 Conversations of momenta, the recitation  <br />
 of keys we call domestic huddle of houses.  <br />
 A loaf of bread baked with rustling vivacious and salt.  <br />
 With the compounding cold fires. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
