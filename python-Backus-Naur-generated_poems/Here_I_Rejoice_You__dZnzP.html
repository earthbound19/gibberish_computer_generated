<h1>Here I Rejoice You</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Molested hearts and distorted bones.  <br />
 I discover as if outside a rusted depth.  <br />
 But the rascal of boys woke the memory.  <br />
 Began and then recovered in the field. <br />
 <br />
 Carry me onto your raft - the apple of my muster of soldiers -  <br />
 halfway.  <br />
 You are going to ask where are the fill?  <br />
 And the pure pastures?  <br />
 And the mist self-assured splattering its graces and harassing them full of  <br />
 jungle and bird? <br />
 <br />
 <br />
