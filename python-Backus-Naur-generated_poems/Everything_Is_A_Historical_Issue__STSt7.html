<h1>Everything Is A Historical Issue</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Return to the homeland of the sweetness.  <br />
 This crooked faucet and seeking choir of angels dismantles me  <br />
 with it's friendly rascals of boys like eyelids and tail  <br />
 and dark baptisms of water like armpit and decks of sailors.  <br />
 You are the tomato of my cheerless heart.  <br />
 Carry me onto your boat - the fruit of my umbrella - <br />
 <br />
 The fuming propeller is profound on your eye.  <br />
 A triangle around a square,  <br />
 the senile workings of blazing law. <br />
 <br />
 From her mouth and her eye reconcile  <br />
 ships of the earth. <br />
