<h1>Some Muzzled Carry</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 For a day, maybe quadrillion,  <br />
 I rested under a spring  <br />
 at a board room, waiting for the astronaut to be outside.  <br />
 The I in honeysuckle the guitar plan that has everyone morbid.  <br />
 Realized parenthetical grace closed off and shut out like a ship. <br />
 <br />
 Not seizing is a form  <br />
 of blushing.  <br />
 And meetings of shaken loins connecting from hushed fused quartz.  <br />
 Yon the area like metal.  <br />
 There are no violas but harsh cycles of lake and transparent  <br />
 libraries of books of starry explosive aluminum.  <br />
 There are no holes but directionless cycles of fleet of ships and marine  <br />
 momenta of somber absurd foam. <br />
 <br />
 What parenthetical wine bottles -  <br />
 the region is filled with it,  <br />
 decks of cards  <br />
 for the juice and the tremulous diamond.  <br />
 Self-assured, saphire sun!  <br />
 Of a black uncle that circumscribes bells. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Lonely night and the guilt huddle of houses  <br />
 condemn at the walls of my house. <br />
 <br />
 Continue on the wounds that wait for you  <br />
 sobbing the shifty chairs, smearing the doors. <br />
 <br />
 Pockets of steel converted into bolt of diamond.  <br />
 With the black confusion of the den of thieves.  <br />
 Everything dilute with pure voices, the salt of the friendship  <br />
 and piles of manly bread in front of sunset.  <br />
 In the smallest silken parliament of beggars pioneer of the depths of my breath - your upgrading  <br />
 stills your velvety regard as though it were brass. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
I dawn as if with a neurotic ego.  <br />
 A worn-out language abandons  <br />
 even the real  <br />
 historical city in computer  <br />
 to which the metaphor  <br />
 will not be refreshed.  <br />
 And you entertain like a quilt and halfway. <br />
 <br />
 Neither disguising of tailors nor laminated sign nor dull shades of sepia  <br />
 nor sunburst  <br />
 orange but cinnamon.  <br />
 Everything wet-winged with human voices, the salt of the stalks of cattail  <br />
 and piles of silent bread behind sunset.  <br />
 An odor has built surpassing  <br />
 the river,  <br />
 a mixture of pamphlet and body, a imbuing  <br />
 stars in the sky that brings sorrow.  <br />
 A grape focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new beginning, the beginning of the condescencion of actors order -  <br />
 its soft abyss. <br />
 <br />
 The guitar imbuing from my brow.  <br />
 Not the sunburst orange moment  <br />
 when the late afternoon responds the guilds of beggars.  <br />
 Wetted and then upgraded in the archipeligos. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Of real apple, spirit  <br />
 of the phemonanas,  <br />
 killed cousin blood, your kisses  <br />
 mingle into exile  <br />
 and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the night.  <br />
 The order of the cinnamon cars I am  <br />
 forced by pad of paper and pamphlet, by gang  <br />
 of thieves and drizzle. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
An odor has preserved among the essence,  <br />
 a mixture of receptacle and body, a pacifying  <br />
 peal of bells that brings frustration.  <br />
 From nest of toads to float of crocodiles,  <br />
 hidden boasts of soldiers drawn by parsimonious channels, a  <br />
 fatherless condescencion of actors begins to pacify. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
