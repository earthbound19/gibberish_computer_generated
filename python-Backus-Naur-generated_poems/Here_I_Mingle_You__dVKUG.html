<h1>Here I Mingle You</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Enjoy the many distorted attempts to develop  <br />
 the celestial skulk of thieves.  <br />
 There is delicate fortune  <br />
 in seeking it.  <br />
 Among the tiger of the land where you sleep,  <br />
 a dream falters into computers.  <br />
 The ancient dignity of the network of computers! <br />
 <br />
 Sometimes a piece of the jungle  <br />
 trembles like a battalion of soldiers in my breast.  <br />
 With the rejecting vinegars.  <br />
 Everything wet-winged with equinoctial voices, the salt of the choir of angels  <br />
 and piles of promising bread  <br />
 behind fortnight. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
A scoop of journalists -like clandenstine  <br />
 phlegms of a barbaous airplane  <br />
 expanding among the room among a weak helicopter,  <br />
 humble as a raucous squirrel.  <br />
 You imbue in the sea as in a boundless university. <br />
 <br />
 As  <br />
 if to faint or appreciate or conquer.  <br />
 In your chest of wicked the heights of seas of bishops tread.  <br />
 To drink lost paths and for wells. <br />
 <br />
 A path focuses its dream of a beginning, its new beginning, the new ending of the trouser order -  <br />
 its brandishing panics.  <br />
 My heart moves from being rotten to being sanguine.  <br />
 They abandoned it with banal sweetness. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
This hushed flower head and understanding ream of paper dismantles me  <br />
 with it's brandishing awes like pimple and nose <br />
 <br />
 And opaque brimstone wings of aircraft like eyeballs and quivers.  <br />
 Nothing but that bunch of things of drunkships of cobblers. <br />
 <br />
 Boney twilight and the raucous troop of soldiers  <br />
 force at the walls of my house. <br />
