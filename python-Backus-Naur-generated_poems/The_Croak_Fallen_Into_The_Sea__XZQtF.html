<h1>The Croak Fallen Into The Sea</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 How enriching is the resplendent serection and it's sensual yeasts?  <br />
 Building a sun  <br />
 enchanted in the self-assured wind. <br />
 <br />
 From her eyes and her breath wake  <br />
 armadas of ships of the earth.  <br />
 The incredulous curtain gave it self-respect.  <br />
 Indicates the bevy of beauties's responding arm.  <br />
 A goblet focuses its dream of a new beginning, its beginning, the ever pausing of the river order -  <br />
 its cosmic errors. <br />
 <br />
 And you passed in the quarrelsome and  <br />
 performed a coagulating unction of undertakers.  <br />
 To seek another land the midnight ambushes of widows you in its mortal wind. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
