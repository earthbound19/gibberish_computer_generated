<h1>Production Without The Wax</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 My heart is filled with convivial like a bolt of silk flute. An odor has drank afar from the trouser,  <br />
 a mixture of acid and body, a beginning  <br />
 band of musicians that brings dejected.  <br />
 The neverthriving of jugglers plays in swimming your ears. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
You are going to ask where are the fill?  <br />
 And the stationary apples?  <br />
 And the thunder enchanting splattering its peaces and harassing them full of  <br />
 thicket and tiger?  <br />
 The lunchtime superfluities of nuns you in its mortal ice.  <br />
 To the changeless changeless planetarium multitude of abominable sight of monkss!  <br />
 In and out of the transparent the sunburst orange and the marine <br />
 <br />
 Shadows of a directionless helicopter  <br />
 showering behind the field among a wet-winged wheel,  <br />
 cleansed as a calcerous  <br />
 crab.  <br />
 And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  <br />
 enchant of roses and alcoves  <br />
 and the nocturnal sun rises of his native land?  <br />
 There ought to be an ambush of widows of a naked farm refreshing in a jungle.  <br />
 In your fingernails of uncouth the city of bird feathers divulge.  <br />
 In your breath of shivering the thicket of giggles of girls crystallize. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Soft, silicon babble of barbers!  <br />
 A car is not enough to crack me and keep me  <br />
 from the city of your serene secrets. <br />
 <br />
