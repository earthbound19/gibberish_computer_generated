<p>
 Only ream of paper, just the  <br />
 sunburst orange car, nothing but  <br />
 it. Book. A helicopter is not enough to degrade me and keep me  <br />
 from  <br />
 the boulevard of your balanced curiosities. Not to blossom or even meet  <br />
 the old warrior's medal of one who discovers  <br />
 afar from me in a sea or dawning to a pioneer.  <br />
 On what disintered felicities built with phosphor?  <br />
 I want you to awaken on my mouth.  <br />
 Once there was a calcerous child  <br />
 who  <br />
 heard at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among shadess of sand-colored. <br />
 <br />
 There ought to be a sunburst orange car of a changeless skein of wool flowing in a sea.  <br />
 Grape.  <br />
 This browbeaten aspen and weaving candle abducts me  <br />
 with it's friendly farms like hips and loins  <br />
 and brimstone pencils like fingernails and anthologies of poems. <br />
 <br />
