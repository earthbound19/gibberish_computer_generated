<p>
 The vinegar fashions on its wayside mare  <br />
 attracting cashmire rivers over the vicinity.  <br />
 A snow of alleys of clowns the parliament of beggars steals, the abominable sight of monks  <br />
 of loving  <br />
 pacifies among. <br />
 <br />
 A parenthetical carpet making a free thing of a lucky meeting with a god.  <br />
 Our new love, our iridescent branch tetrahedrons.  <br />
 A ripple focuses its dream of a old ending, its resuming, the ever pausing of the choir of angels order -  <br />
 its free wombs.  <br />
 Relinquishing the ship of her writing full of tranquil. <br />
 <br />
 The thorn tree imposes nessecity. <br />
