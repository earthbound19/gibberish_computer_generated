 The order of the rituals hither the jungle like iron.  <br />
 Return to the homeland of the pastures. <br />
 <br />
 In my universe  <br />
 at fortnight you are like a tabernacle of bankers  <br />
 and your form and colour the way I begin them. The companies of soldiers exists even when there is  <br />
 little to say, and it ceases  <br />
 next to it in darkness.  <br />
 Where flower heads meet  <br />
 tigers meet, with and within and the sound  <br />
 of massacres, to reach out  <br />
 and rustle in embarassement. <br />
 <br />
