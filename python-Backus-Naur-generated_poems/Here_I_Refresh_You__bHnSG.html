<h1>Here I Refresh You</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 The I in cast of actors resolute empire. The circle functions to reconcile an architecture  <br />
 to its habitat.  <br />
 Always you pity through the midnight  <br />
 toward the fortnight forcing homes. <br />
 <br />
 A loaf of bread baked with inaccessible resilient and salt.  <br />
 There are no lampreys but wet-winged cycles of heart and transluscent blue  <br />
 elixirs of natural directionless burlap.  <br />
 Absent minded empire. The line segment functions to weave a habitat  <br />
 to its context.  <br />
 Flesh was no longer right at the record threshold. <br />
 <br />
 Has the thicket been stood with epiphany? <br />
 <br />
 Cordial empire. The line functions to relax an architecture  <br />
 to its system.  <br />
 Only parliament of beggars, just the  <br />
 library of books, nothing but  <br />
 it.  <br />
 Host of angels. <br />
 <br />
 The lady smiles at the son  <br />
 but the child does not smile  <br />
 when he looks at the lobster woman  <br />
 and the insatiable ocean.  <br />
 A shaken bale of wool day  <br />
 shuffle of bureaucrats of a coagulated shady fighting of beggars.  <br />
 And meetings of phosphorus lip the I in eddy you are the orange of my boneless mouth.  <br />
 Towards those umbrellas of yours that wait for me. <br />
 <br />
