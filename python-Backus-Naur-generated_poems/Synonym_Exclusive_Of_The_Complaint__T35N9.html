<p>
 I stayed heard and burnt umber  <br />
 in the middle of the sea.  <br />
 The flotilla of ships buries, the law of noble  <br />
 excites outside. <br />
 <br />
 The juice reflects in weaving your armpit.  <br />
 So the full somber lives on in a fruit,  <br />
 the fluidic  <br />
 house of the key,  <br />
 the dashing panel of experts that is winged and boundless. <br />
 <br />
 Pockets of steel converted into glass.  <br />
 Not continuing is a form of lighting. <br />
