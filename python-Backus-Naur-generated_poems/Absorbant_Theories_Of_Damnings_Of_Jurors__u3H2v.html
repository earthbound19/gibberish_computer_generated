 And so that its felicities will  <br />
 delude your leg.  <br />
 Carry me onto your train - the lemon of my bunch of things -  <br />

 currents of domestic wet-winged aluminum. <br />
 <br />
 Beyond the smothered vicinity of careless splendor.  <br />
 Realized blazing pasture the guitar plan that has everyone careless.  <br />
 Next to opaque marine water and sepia warmths of your body. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
The worn-out horse that perches in your chorus of angels. <br />
 <br />
 Rescue on the shadows that wait for you  <br />
 puncturing the careless chairs, petrifying the doors. <br />
 <br />
 Thirsty seperations and callous waxes.  <br />
 Like the bitterest brick of springtimes troupe of dancers of a struck rambunctious dew.  <br />
 Harsh violas and tear stained alarms.  <br />
 Cashmire brambles of lightning,  <br />
 deep brown seams above a hushed sea's  <br />
 skin. <br />

 and the unguessed branches of his native land?  <br />
 Multitude of bands of musicians!  <br />
 In and out of the blue the silvery and the deep brown <br />
 <br />
 There are many salivas outside wet-winged events.  <br />
 Everybody here is waiting for the next coat.  <br />
 Dew. You continued yourself for mixing.  <br />
 To the angellic  <br />
 stationary old warrior's medal full stop.  <br />
 The astronaut smiles at the gentleman  <br />
 but the stranger does not smile  <br />
 when he looks at the turkey pioneer  <br />
 and the bitten ocean. <br />
