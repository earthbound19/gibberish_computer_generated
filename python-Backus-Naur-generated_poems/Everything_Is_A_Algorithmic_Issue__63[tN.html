<h1>Everything Is A Algorithmic Issue</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Towards those choirs of singers of yours that wait for me. Coral of a overflowed sticky bevy of beauties.  <br />
 I'm the person to the mosaic of immediate autumn.  <br />
 Of your dark precision when you hold out your brain.  <br />
 A chorus of elephants at afternoon un trusted un coddled  <br />
 comes to a halt before a illusion of painters. <br />
 <br />
 When you fashion rescued like a huddle of players. <br />
