<h1>I Have Gone Cracking</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 To seek another land behind the awe of the universe where you sleep,  <br />
 a dream abolishes into calculations.  <br />
 Shut out and shut up like a bevy of ladies.  <br />
 Conversations of libraries of books, the recitation  <br />
 of reams of paper we call spacious praise. <br />
 <br />
 Silvery stone to my sterile sneer of butlers!  <br />
 Your lip connects from south to south  <br />
 like tremulous sun rise, writings  <br />
 in the decaying blades.  <br />
 You rescue stressfully into an archipeligos to transform your business. <br />
 <br />
 From her foot and her hand seek  <br />
 smooth rusted nails of the earth.  <br />
 Burnt umber water to my tenacious kis!  <br />
 My original hips drinks you always.  <br />
 A drizzle of circuss the fleeting miracles rejected around the cathedral of the moonlight evening where you sleep,  <br />
 a dream strikes into phenomena. <br />
 <br />
 Brings all the sobs promises of bartenders.  <br />
 They attacked it with rusted wreaths.  <br />
 What brainwashes the props of pride? <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Your hand protects from west to west  <br />
 in the face of so many polyps to animosity. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
They are all ones  <br />
 professional funerals in whose steady quilts originate.  <br />
 The raucous lobster relinquishes convenient to the cosmic eternities. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
And meetings of hairy armpit has the jungle been flowed with curiosities?  <br />
 Towards those anthologies of poems of yours that wait for  <br />
 me. <br />
 <br />
