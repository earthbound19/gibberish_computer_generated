<p>
Reflect on the evils  <br />
 that wait for you  <br />
 passing the burned-out chairs, dying the doors.  <br />
 It's a flowing coat of stains. <br />
 <br />
 A choir of singers focuses its dream of a new ending, its new beginning, the ending of the cactus order -  <br />
 its incredulous abberations. A great wood paneling making a essential thing of a probable meeting with a person.  <br />
 From her armpit and her lip reconcile  <br />
 magnoliums of the earth.  <br />
 Towards those fleets of cars of yours that wait for me.  <br />
 Acidulous weather, melancholy lights like the umbrella. <br />
