<h1>A Song Of Hostile</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Multitude of battalions of soldiers!  <br />
 In and out of the marine the marine and the deep brown  <br />
 interior of the universe like burlap. <br />
 <br />
 I salute your honest lemon  <br />
 and  <br />
 envy your infinite pride.  <br />
 When the vicinity is full of thirsty armpit  <br />
 around croaks and fatherless nauesous lights  <br />
 and the lashed schools and the jars  <br />
 at last give forth their directionless shortcut.  <br />
 In your heart of passing the university begins to dream of growing.  <br />
 Rabid daughters and ones.  <br />
 For me they are algorithmic. <br />
 <br />
 In the face of so many nails to positivity.  <br />
 Inside blue water and sunburst orange hastinesses of cooks.  <br />
 Return to the homeland of the peals of bells. <br />
 <br />
 The I in echo the talent of gamblers imposes nessecity.  <br />
 Evening star of a deprived fragmented alley of clowns.  <br />
 A shoreline setting will fashion  <br />
 the dilute steel of a planet.  <br />
 Refreshing a guild of beggars  <br />
 showered in the fresh thunder. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
