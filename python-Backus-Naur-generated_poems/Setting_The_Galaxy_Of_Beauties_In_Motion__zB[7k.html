<h1>Setting The Galaxy Of Beauties In Motion</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Everything torrential with equinoctial voices, the salt of the precision  <br />
 and piles of musical bread among midnight.  <br />
 You are the clotting father of a elephant,  <br />
 the boney ness of the smooth steel, the power of the silt. <br />
 <br />
 But the huddle of houses magnified the memory.  <br />
 A book -like consequence  <br />
 the reasons for my respect  <br />
 are entertained in  <br />
 my fingernails of gem. <br />
 <br />
 Cold fires of a hairy vessel  <br />
 rising inside the universe outside a bitter boat,  <br />
 electric as a bitter turkey. <br />
