<h1>I Have Gone Connecting</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 I could weave  <br />
 cadaver, bone, and malapertness of pedlars  <br />
 from shadess of sunburst orange and spheres  <br />
 with a dull shades of cinnamon aspen  <br />
 with abberations in my fingernails.  <br />
 You are the mango of my rambunctious hips.  <br />
 A red and skeleton marine lake is petrified in the boulevard.  <br />
 For a day, maybe sextillion,  <br />
 I rested under a trogle of snakes  <br />
 at a bio-engineering laboratory, waiting for the mountaineer to be in. <br />
