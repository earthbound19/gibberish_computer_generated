 In the smallest chalk blush of boys amid the opaque ultraviolet spooked of the corpse.  <br />
 Abhor me and let my substance relinquish.  <br />
 You store my fragmented shards of gem  <br />

 <br />
 <br />
I saw how skeins of wool are rose  <br />
 by the infinite wing of aircraft. <br />
