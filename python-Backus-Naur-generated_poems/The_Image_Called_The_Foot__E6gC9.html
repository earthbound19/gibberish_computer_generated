<h1>The Image Called The Foot</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 What buries the props of tenacious?  <br />
 A loop in front of a triangle,  <br />
 the burned-out workings of enduring law. <br />
 <br />
 I  <br />
 saw how psalters of bishops are mixed  <br />
 by the noble current.  <br />
 Wave of wave of energies rolling down the sea.  <br />
 Return to the homeland of the maps. <br />
 <br />
 I took on tenacious echoes. <br />
 <br />
 Pulse on the acids that wait for you  <br />
 overflowing the clotting chairs, imprisoning the doors.  <br />
 The writing showering from my lip.  <br />
 Your observance of hermits is a cry of players filled with guilt ream of paper.  <br />
 Went discovered in cast of actors a fleeting snow of doves. <br />
 <br />
 Your shoulder loves from south to south  <br />
 come with me to the rectum of whispers.  <br />
 Towards those droplets of yours that wait for me. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
But the deck of sailors performed the memory.  <br />
 Burnt umber ice to my disordered honeysuckle! <br />
 <br />
 This sticky fleet of ships and shining aspen deforms me  <br />
 with it's soft prizes like fingernails and tail  <br />
 and turqoise warmths of your body like shoulder and locks of hair. <br />
 <br />
 Wave of wave of gardens rolling down the sea.  <br />
 One of them is serene,  <br />
 the other knows inscriptions.  <br />
 Where is everyone  <br />
 she cries, and when can we see what  <br />
 is going to happen?  <br />
 Pure cubicle reconciles the libraries of books  <br />
 attract on the wounds that wait for you  <br />
 ignoring the whirlwinds of chairs, executing the doors. <br />
 <br />
 Shortcuts of a listless train  <br />
 recovering next to the thicket among a fatherless car,  <br />
 somber as a insufferable squirrel.  <br />
 I'd do it for the harmony of singers in which you recover  <br />
 for the awes of sepia you've blossomed.  <br />
 With its communist hear realized nocturnal jar indicates the thread's perfuming brow. <br />
 <br />
