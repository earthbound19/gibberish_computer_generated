<h1>The Granule Fallen Into The Sea</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 The divisions outside hers  <br />
 a story we divulge in passing,  <br />
 with notions of kindness  <br />
 and a passion for jouranlism and oceanography elated is gone, the subject has seized.  <br />
 One historical option and mixing the worship of writers of her bale of wool full of content. <br />
 <br />
 And the bale  <br />
 of wool to its glaze of tourists  <br />
 and among the locks of hair the spacious one  <br />
 the giant covered with decisive promise.  <br />
 This careless fragrance of strawberry and developing affection taunts me  <br />
 with it's arcane quivers like eyelids and breast  <br />
 and ultraviolet curtains like hand and alcoves. <br />
