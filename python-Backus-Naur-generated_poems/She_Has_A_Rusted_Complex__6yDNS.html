 My heart is filled with humility like a silicon umbrella.  <br />
 Draw from it the inaccessible  <br />
 image of its own calculation. <br />
 <br />
 I stayed flew and crimson  <br />
 interior of the region.  <br />
 But the flint formed the memory. <br />
 <br />
 Setting from frail crystal.  <br />
 A loaf of bread baked with wet-winged sober and salt.  <br />
 Travelled and then formed in the sea. <br />
 <br />
 What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  <br />
 This explosive awe and developing condescencion of actors passes me  <br />
 with it's stationary mosaics like eye and hips  <br />
 and turqoise companies of actors like brain and observances of hermits.  <br />
 The galaxy of beauties plan that has everyone motionless.  <br />
 Inside transparent water and marine choirs of angels. <br />
 <br />
 Not the sepia moment  <br />
 when the lunchtime gallops the silences.  <br />
 A lovely snow of faucets.  <br />
 Fewer and fewer  <br />
 harass about another mode of timorous.  <br />
 When you return like bevy of girls showered by the sulfur. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
The woman smiles at the mountaineer  <br />
 but the elder does not smile  <br />
 when he looks at the lobster god  <br />
 and the putrid ocean.  <br />
 Gentleman of the depths of my foot - your beginning  <br />
 stills your starry regard as though it were wind. <br />
 <br />
