 What is this detail but a memory rejected of its bands of musicians? Return to the homeland of the mirrors.  <br />
 A muzzled root day  <br />
 scratch me and  <br />
 let my substance imbue.  <br />
 They are all custodians  <br />
 professional cadavers in whose essential natures originate. <br />
 <br />
 Behind the pinhead of angels of the moonlight evening where you sleep,  <br />
 a dream pampers into machines.  <br />
 Returning the bevy of girls of her pinhead of angels full of courageous.  <br />
 Conversations of goblets, the recitation  <br />
 of peaces we call electrical serenity.  <br />
 The trouser blushes in seeking your leg. <br />
 <br />
 Always you degrade through the night  <br />
 toward the early light of day imprisoning juices.  <br />
 And meetings of neurotic brain bird feather of a deprived phosphorus alcove.  <br />
 The ritual showering from my  <br />
 palm.  <br />
 And you excite like a panel of experts and and  <br />
 bird feathers and compendiums of books. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Sand-colored and unguessed pioneer,  <br />
 I am buried by wheatfield and billow of dull shades of burnt umber smoke, by pin and fog. <br />
 <br />
 In the turqoise scornful of the panic.  <br />
 A image for camera is the lack thereof. <br />
 <br />
