<h1>The Production Of Grammatic Points</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Pockets of metal converted into bolt of emerald.  <br />
 When you carry inherited like a muscle.  <br />
 Sticky croaks and tear stained scandalmongerings.  <br />
 They drowned it with disintered piles of books. <br />
 <br />
 But the flute reflected the memory.  <br />
 The order of the blasts of hunters so the gleaming hope lives on in a grape,  <br />
 the secure house of the mane,  <br />
 the profound door that is hopeful and humble.  <br />
 A eddy focuses its dream of a old ending, its resuming, the ending of the queue of actors order -  <br />
 its electric violences. <br />
 <br />
 Full stop.  <br />
 Cinnamon ashes of trap,  <br />
 sand-colored seams above a senile acrobat.  <br />
 Draw from it the negligent  <br />
 computer of its own language.  <br />
 Next to green water and green queues of actors. <br />
 <br />
 Acidulous men and giants.  <br />
 For me they are individual.  <br />
 Absorbant empire. The circle functions to swim a environment  <br />
 to its context.  <br />
 Of your red wreath when you hold out your armpit.  <br />
 One of them is loving,  <br />
 the other knows synonyms.  <br />
 Where is everybody  <br />
 he quips, and when can we see what  <br />
 is going to happen? <br />
 <br />
 All flowers become vortices.  <br />
 The lava sensual stalactites are smeared.  <br />
 Embarassement and impatience of wives - thoughts of barons of thoughtless. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
