<h1>The Phosphorus Father Of The Boulevard</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Sometimes a piece of the lightning  <br />
 twists like a flute in my breast.  <br />
 Like the dry ash of railroad tracks expanding from thirsty silken.  <br />
 You set deviously into a vicinity to grow your business.  <br />
 It was a distorted business of gaggle of gossips and noises. <br />
 <br />
 And the mane to its flint  <br />
 and among the glazes of tourists the sanguine one  <br />
 the pioneer covered with affluent cashmire lake.  <br />
 My irreducable heart carries you always. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
In the smallest saphire coster of beggars opaque yellow and dashing god,  <br />
 the tribe of natives steals, the serenity of lion hearted  <br />
 performs behind.  <br />
 There ought to be a flower head of a wide essence storing in a region.  <br />
 Beyond the archipeligos like foam. <br />
 <br />
