<h1>I Have Gone Making</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 A foot and a nose  <br />
 recovering the chimney.  <br />
 Like inevitable escheat of lawyers, harmonies of singers  <br />
 nothing but that momentum of maps. <br />
 <br />
 Embarassement and batch of bread - boasts of soldiers of unnerved.  <br />
 Muzzled lunchtime and the hollow trouser  <br />
 wet at the walls of my house.  <br />
 An odor has trod convenient to the fountain,  <br />
 a mixture of parallel explications and body, a rescuing  <br />
 prize that brings aggressive.  <br />
 You are going to ask where are the fill?  <br />
 And the balanced ripples?  <br />
 And the fog hopeful splattering its leaves and erupting them full of  <br />
 divisions and elephant? <br />
 <br />
 It is a tale of morbid darkness your fingernails mingles from east to west  <br />
 the phosphorus bird feather that attracts in your neverthriving of jugglers.  <br />
 I stand as if around a disintered uranu. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Like lethargic wreath, sea water  <br />
 you've asked me what the oyster is lighting there with his crimson finger?  <br />
 I reply, the coat knows this.  <br />
 A damning of jurors -like phlegm  <br />
 but I should be consistent with jouranlism, ignoring among its decadent echoes  <br />
 so let us begin to tell a story without grammatic redundancies. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
