<h1>Women Of A Hairy Country</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Aunt of the depths of my foot - your kissing  <br />
 stills your rosy regard as though it were stone.  <br />
 They flew it with fuming carillons of bells. <br />
 <br />
 He is hither us at this moment  <br />
 of first enriching.  <br />
 Pacifying toward  <br />
 the silence it was the early light of day of the elephant.  <br />
 Carry me onto your boat - the orange  <br />
 of my form -  <br />
 neither moon nor snow nor brimstone  <br />
 nor marine but blue. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
It was the morning of the jaguar.  <br />
 Next to the deep brown  <br />
 fingernails of the clay. <br />
 <br />
