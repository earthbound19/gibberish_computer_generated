<h1>Since The End</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 I wish to make a tangent arc  <br />
 around, and every hearing, many  <br />
 times hidden in a splendor.  <br />
 The sea next to hers  <br />
 a legend we divulge in passing,  <br />
 with notions of humorous  <br />
 and a passion for photography and mountaineering <br />
 <br />
 Not the transparent moment  <br />
 when the night gallops the costers of beggars.  <br />
 With the dove of the modern office where you sleep,  <br />
 a dream loiters into identities. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
In the smallest marble love alcove of a congealed cold dew.  <br />
 In the first scene, the wonderful son  <br />
 is abhorred by a pioneer. In the second  <br />
 reel he returns, to drink and to conduct. <br />
 <br />
