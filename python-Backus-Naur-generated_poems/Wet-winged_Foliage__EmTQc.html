<h1>Wet-winged Foliage</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  <br />
 Nothing but that goring of butchers of flags. <br />
 <br />
 When the heights is full of bitter armpit  <br />
 around trash barges and rabid bitter folds of chairs  <br />
 and the hairy huddles of players and the obeisances of servants  <br />
 at last give forth their inevitable city.  <br />
 This melancholy sun rise and rising cactus impales me  <br />
 with it's careful bells like breast and eyelids  <br />
 and  <br />
 dark candles like pimple and platoons of soldiers. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
A blast of hunters focuses its dream of a resuming, its ever pausing, the new ending of the quilt order -  <br />
 its full blades.  <br />
 The holiday splendors you in  <br />
 its mortal clay. <br />
 <br />
