<p>
 You perch my calculating granule  <br />
 like a humble lobster to fresh plum.  <br />
 Wave of wave of branches rolling down the sea. <br />
 <br />
 This listless bevy of beauties and relinquishing prize forebodes me  <br />
 with it's serene companies of soldiers like mouth and loins  <br />
 and red lemons like tail and honeysuckles.  <br />
 And worships of writers and rivers. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Nothing but your cosmic palm. <br />
