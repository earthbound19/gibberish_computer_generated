<h1>A Form To Transform The Glazes Of Tourists You Fly</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Exterior of the region like broken glass.  <br />
 You blossom in the room as in a parenthetical chimney.  <br />
 When the archipeligos is full of rabid tail  <br />
 amid dominions and tear stained wounded snows  <br />
 and the atrocious candles and the reams of paper  <br />
 at last give forth their chaotic clock.  <br />
 When you perfume excited like a retinue of players. <br />
 <br />
 Where flags meet  <br />
 packs of cards meet, amid and inside and the sound  <br />
 of greeds of lawyers, to reach out and appreciate in ferocious.  <br />
 Return to the homeland of the blushes of boys.  <br />
 The aluminum angellic wounds are deprived. <br />
 <br />
 When the land is full of rambunctious hips  <br />
 next to trapdoors and ghostly lewd illusions of magicians  <br />
 and the listless bottles and the roots  <br />
 at last give forth their clenched probe.  <br />
 Of incredulous orange, spirit  <br />
 of the doors,  <br />
 dismantled mother blood, your kisses  <br />
 transform into exile  <br />
 and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the thicket.  <br />
 In the deck of sailors of the heights where you sleep,  <br />
 a dream  <br />
 abducts into identities.  <br />
 Serendipidous, ivory thread! <br />
 <br />
 Multitude of skeins of wool!  <br />
 In and out of the sepia the yellow and the sepia  <br />
 only hushed and to a  <br />
 daughter they take on time, hundred years  <br />
 gentleman of the depths of my finger - your mingling  <br />
 stills your round regard as though it were silt.  <br />
 In your arm of irascible the vicinity of sea water store.  <br />
 From her loins and her heart blush  <br />
 railroad tracks of the earth. <br />
 <br />
 What wipes the props of powerful?  <br />
 Fire-tipped cadavers and tremulous cummerbunds.  <br />
 Crystallized and then transformed in the jungle. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Always you chain through the sunset  <br />
 toward the morning changing branches.  <br />
 As soon as the incoming condescencions of actors  <br />
 gives the aerial indication. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
To the sensual unguessed flock of tourists I want you to discover on my nose.  <br />
 Where promises meet  <br />
 planetariums meet, next to and inside and the sound  <br />
 of lineages, to reach out and perch in quarrelsome. <br />
 <br />
 And the ribbon to its ship  <br />
 and among the decks of sailors the iridescent one  <br />
 the god covered with promising well. <br />
