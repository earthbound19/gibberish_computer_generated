<h1>There Is No Trap</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Of a ultraviolet cousin that lights flutes.  <br />
 There are no seperations but distorted cycles of droplet and blue  <br />
 serenities of self-assured  <br />
 skeleton salt. <br />
 <br />
 Pulled out and closed off like a disguising of tailors.  <br />
 To excite lost veins and for fountains.  <br />
 There are no ashes but insufferable cycles of fold of chairs and cinnamon  <br />
 bottles of serene mourning metal.  <br />
 I stayed imbued and silvery  <br />
 inside the university. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
But I should be inconsistent with engineering, mourning among its tremulous currents  <br />
 so let us seek to tell a story without neutral redundancies.  <br />
 Of your rust colored home when you hold out your foot. <br />
 <br />
