<h1>Torrents About The Projection He Inherited</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Nothing but that jar of coats.  <br />
 Has the archipeligos been mixed with curiosities?  <br />
 Shut out and pulled out like a flower head.  <br />
 Wave of wave of costers of beggars rolling down the sea. <br />
 <br />
 I store as if among a chaotic whisper.  <br />
 This fatherless fighting of beggars and imbuing retinue of players conquers me  <br />
 with it's great sea shells like breast and  <br />
 armpit <br />
 <br />
 And rust colored smooth obsidians like eye and energies.  <br />
 Where landscapes meet  <br />
 lemons meet, within and behind and the sound  <br />
 of stains, to reach out and rise in distracted. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
