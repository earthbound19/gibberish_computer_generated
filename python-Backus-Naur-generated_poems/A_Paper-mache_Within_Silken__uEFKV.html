<h1>A Paper-mache Within Silken</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Conversations of marine cars, the recitation  <br />
 of femininities we call steady scoop of journalists.  <br />
 One of them is nocturnal,  <br />
 the other knows details.  <br />
 Where is everybody  <br />
 she quips, and when can we see what  <br />
 is going to happen? <br />
 <br />
 Conversations of casts of actors, the recitation  <br />
 of hearts we call changeless pack of cards.  <br />
 You are going to ask where are the fill?  <br />
 And the stationary sea water?  <br />
 And the sun eloquent splattering its galaxies of beauties and puncturing them full of  <br />
 area and lobster?  <br />
 It's a relinquishing harmony of singers of juices. <br />
 <br />
