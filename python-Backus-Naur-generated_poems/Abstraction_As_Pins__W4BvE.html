<h1>Abstraction As Pins</h1>

<p>
 Weaving toward the phalanx of umbrellas the sweet-smelling companies of actors coddled fewer and fewer  <br />
 electrify about another mode of exhilaration.  <br />
 A fragmented leaf day  <br />
 only hollow and to a  <br />
 woman they take on time, hundred years <br />
 <br />
 I took on lonely hastinesses of cooks.  <br />
 It was a hairy business of evil and skulks of thieves.  <br />
 A identity flows,  <br />
 shakes - it does not return.  <br />
 The neon bird stores in the middle of the aquatic polyps. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Discovering toward the glaze of tourists and lakes and bird feathers.  <br />
 Outside the oily jungle of difficult neverthriving of jugglers.  <br />
 You are the wounded giant of a tiger,  <br />
 the disordered ness of the drop, the power of the sulfur.  <br />
 Always you chain through the sunrise  <br />
 toward the morning loitering clusters. <br />
 <br />
 A choir of singers focuses its dream of a ever pausing, its new beginning, the old ending of the lock of hair order -  <br />
 its parenthetical gates.  <br />
 A ship is not enough to attack me and keep me  <br />
 from the divisions of your great mysteries.  <br />
 From her nose and her eyeballs hear  <br />
 flints of the earth. <br />
 <br />
  <br />
