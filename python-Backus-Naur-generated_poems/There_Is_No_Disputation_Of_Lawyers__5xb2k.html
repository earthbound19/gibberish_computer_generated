<h1>There Is No Disputation Of Lawyers</h1>

<p>
 We get the sight  <br />
 they must lots to kiss  <br />
 to each other  <br />
 or perhaps nothing but nights.  <br />
 Perhaps they are not deformed.  <br />
 Deep brown and decisive daughter,  <br />
 green bloods of trash barge,  <br />
 opaque deep brown seams above a silent bottle.  <br />
 When you weave fashioned like a cluster of things. <br />
 <br />
 Where wreaths meet  <br />
 lighthouses meet, in and outside and the sound  <br />
 of masks, to reach out and entertain in depressed. I continue as if outside a cheerless mask.  <br />
 A calculation conducts,  <br />
 kills - it does not return.  <br />
 Everything sordid with nocturnal voices, the salt of the vein  <br />
 and piles  <br />
 of romantic bread next to sunrise.  <br />
 There ought to be a platoon of soldiers of a vertical poppy swimming in a university. <br />
 <br />
