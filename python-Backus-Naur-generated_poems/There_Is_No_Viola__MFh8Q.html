<h1>There Is No Viola</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Not the transparent moment  <br />
 when the sunset connects the echoes.  <br />
 I want you to understand on my chest.  <br />
 The bevy of girls plan that has everyone communist. <br />
 <br />
 Perpendicular to the vicinity like broken glass.  <br />
 For lake was smothered and morally positive.  <br />
 Conversations of fleets of ships, the recitation  <br />
 of illusions of magicians we call profound sea's skin.  <br />
 The obscene squirrel rises outside the cleansed malapertnesses of pedlars. <br />
 <br />
 I'd do it for the quilt in which you mix  <br />
 for the folds of chairs of sunburst orange you've inherited.  <br />
 What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  <br />
 A chorus of oysters at midnight un rose un pitied  <br />
 comes to a halt before a bunch of things.  <br />
 Pockets of iron converted into silk.  <br />
 Obeisance of servants of a petrified whirlwinds of productivity. <br />
 <br />
 In the smallest chalk necklace and a shady illusion of magicians's tin will awaken you.  <br />
 Serendipity.  <br />
 Of your red current when you hold out your eye. <br />
 <br />
