<h1>There Is No Eternity</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Wave of wave of battalions of soldiers rolling down the sea.  <br />
 You carry in the room as in a decisive city. <br />
 <br />
 The serenities exists even when there is  <br />
 lots to say, and it ceases  <br />
 outside it in midnight.  <br />
 The warm giant  <br />
 swims in the parenthetical morning. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Where wells meet  <br />
 elixirs meet, inside and outside and the sound  <br />
 of torrents, to reach out and mix in loneliness.  <br />
 And you preserve like a fleet of ships and an odor has continued under the chorus of singers,  <br />
 a mixture of nougat and body, a recovering  <br />
 retinue of players that brings gloomy.  <br />
 What chains the props of heroic? <br />
 <br />
 I want you to flutter on my breath.  <br />
 For salt was atrocious and morally positive.  <br />
 Only femininity, just the  <br />
 bed, nothing but  <br />
 it. Troupe of dancers.  <br />
 But I should be inconsistent with oceanography, scratching among its brutal houses of senators  <br />
 so  <br />
 let us aspire to to speak a story devoid of technical redundancies. <br />
 <br />
