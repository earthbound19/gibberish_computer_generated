<h1>The Image Called The Mouth</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 You drink my ironous abys  <br />
 like a thick lobster to fresh peach.  <br />
 I wish to make a line segment  <br />
 among, and  <br />
 every meaning, many  <br />
 times hidden in a goblet.  <br />
 Furtive is gone, the subject has fluttered. <br />
 <br />
 With its insufferable build like clenched peal of bells, bevies of ladies  <br />
 like explications smearing outside drunkships of cobblers.  <br />
 Undulate me and let my substance preserve.  <br />
 You are the tomato of my blood-stained armpit. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
There are no dungs but forceful cycles of planetarium and sunburst orange  <br />
 pullulations of starry oily sand.  <br />
 On what calculating vagabonds pacified with water? <br />
 <br />
 The gleaming god <br />
 <br />
 Breathes in the wonderful morning.  <br />
 The pure cousin  <br />
 treads in the careful morning.  <br />
 He is apex of us at this moment of first transforming. <br />
 <br />
 One slightest option and and the change of bells to its obeisance of servants  <br />
 and among the coats the nocturnal one  <br />
 the child covered with real kis.  <br />
 Wounded weather, fractious lights like the chorus of singers.  <br />
 The ghost creates on its careless mare  <br />
 seeking crimson silences over the area.  <br />
 It blushes like an armada of ships outside the board of directors.  <br />
 For acrobat was pale and morally positive. <br />
 <br />
 We get the sight  <br />
 they must lots to relinquish  <br />
 to each other  <br />
 or perhaps nothing but seperations.  <br />
 Perhaps they are not drowned.  <br />
 The posse of police plan that has everyone silent.  <br />
 Someone here is waiting for the next fleet of ships.  <br />
 Bevy of beauties. You transformed yourself for loving. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Brutal weather, lewd lights like the dove.  <br />
 Torrents of a lewd helicopter  <br />
 chirping inside the night within a dead wheel,  <br />
 verdure as a lashed cat. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Sunburst orange and noble sailor,  <br />
 come with  <br />
 me to the lance of pigeon holes. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
