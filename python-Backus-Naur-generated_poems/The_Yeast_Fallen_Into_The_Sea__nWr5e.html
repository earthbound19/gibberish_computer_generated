<h1>The Yeast Fallen Into The Sea</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 I wish to make a triangle  <br />
 behind, and every color, many  <br />
 times hidden in a window.  <br />
 If I could transform the ego and the vicinity. <br />
 <br />
 I'm the custodian to the brigade of soldiers of immediate sweetnes.  <br />
 I was without doubt the mother ostrich  <br />
 there in the bitten jungle.  <br />
 When it looked me with its  <br />
 poetic flesh eyes  <br />
 it had neither eyes nor eyes  <br />
 but saphire babbles of barbers on its sides. <br />
