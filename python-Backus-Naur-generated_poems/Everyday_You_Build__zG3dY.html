<h1>Everyday You Build</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 A souffle of clouds focuses its dream of a beginning, its old ending, the old ending of the productivity order -  <br />
 its honest yeasts.  <br />
 One individual option and we get the abstraction  <br />
 they must lots to refresh  <br />
 to each other  <br />
 or perhaps nothing but legumes.  <br />
 Perhaps they are not entangled.  <br />
 A transparent tribe of natives develops.  <br />
 Shut out and pulled out like a flesh. <br />
 <br />
 With its  <br />
 banal re-cover when the jungle is full of distorted eyelids  <br />
 around howls and imperalist careless knaves  <br />
 and the rusted companies of actors and the laws  <br />
 at last give forth their dead massacre.  <br />
 Like torrential muster of soldiers, scoops of journalists  <br />
 conversations of scoldings of seamstresses, the recitation  <br />
 of springtimes we call blazing doctrine of doctors.  <br />
 Wave of wave of laminated signs rolling down the sea. <br />
 <br />
 A chorus of birds at twilight un entertained un wiped  <br />
 comes to a halt before a circus. Only congregation of people, just the  <br />
 glaze of tourists, nothing but  <br />
 it. Rascal of boys.  <br />
 What cracks the props of wild?  <br />
 Prosecute me and let my substance circumscribe.  <br />
 The order of the costers of beggars the obeisance of servants knows this,  <br />
 that life in it's gold boxes is as endless as the hand of cards. <br />
 <br />
 Conversations of books, the recitation  <br />
 of ambushes of widows we call infinite ribbon.  <br />
 The smooth stone loves in upgrading your loins.  <br />
 The gypsum aquatic holes are devoured. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
