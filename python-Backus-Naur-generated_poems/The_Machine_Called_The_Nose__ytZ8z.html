<h1>The Machine Called The Nose</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 The acidulous impatience of wives is starry on your palm.  <br />
 Realized delicious choir of singers you - the moonlit finger. <br />
 <br />
 But I should be in line with science, lunging among its mechanical keys  <br />
 so let us attempt to speak a story without side redundancies.  <br />
 Nothing but your boundless curves.  <br />
 To the celestial color of the gem cluster of things.  <br />
 My heart is filled with euphoric like a fused quartz squad of soldiers. <br />
 <br />
 Shut up and shut up like a time.  <br />
 Always you scratch through the holiday  <br />
 toward the twilight mutating currents.  <br />
 A drunkship of cobblers -like shadow  <br />
 when you gallop like horse perfumed by the fire. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
You are the communist child of a pheasant,  <br />
 the fire-tipped ness of the quiver, the power of the steel.  <br />
 Fewer and fewer  <br />
 shake about another mode of vigorous. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
