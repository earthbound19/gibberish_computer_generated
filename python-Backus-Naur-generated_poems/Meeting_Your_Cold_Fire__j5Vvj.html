<h1>Meeting Your Cold Fire</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  <br />
 gather of congregations of people and skeins of wool  <br />
 and the silent illusions of painters of his native land?  <br />
 The brass equinoctial jackals are trembled.  <br />
 The rascal of boys excites in rustling your eyes. <br />
 <br />
 A antenna for study is the lack thereof.  <br />
 Halfway.  <br />
 Enjoy the many insufferable attempts to breathe  <br />
 the serendipidous gate.  <br />
 There is myriad fortune in inheriting it.  <br />
 Of a brimstone son that enriches  <br />
 glazes of tourists. <br />
 <br />
 Full stop.  <br />
 And you rise like a muscle and the huddle of players magnifies in carrying your toe.  <br />
 Realized myriad huddle of lawyers a opaque dull shades of silvery and morbid army of soldiers is condemned in the night.  <br />
 Like stenches foreboding in obeisances of servants. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
It's a growing scoop of journalists of nails.  <br />
 There are many trapdoors inside demonic events. <br />
 <br />
 Always you prosecute through the night  <br />
 toward the twilight burying crowds of people.  <br />
 The neurotic forest is round on your tail. <br />
 <br />
 We open the halves of a epiphany and the  <br />
 trembling of incantations of witches entertains into the vertical city.  <br />
 And behind my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  <br />
 and full of heroic.  <br />
 Everything decadent with iridescent voices, the salt of the lighthouse  <br />
 and piles of plumed bread in front of twilight.  <br />
 For a day, maybe six,  <br />
 I rested under a herd of seahorses  <br />
 at a photography booth, waiting for the stranger to be with. <br />
 <br />
