<p>
 I was without doubt the daughter elephant  <br />
 there in the furious moonlight evening.  <br />
 When it looked me with its poetic flower head eyes  <br />
 it had neither nose nor heart  <br />
 but ivory disguisings of tailors on its sides.  <br />
 The pasture reconciling from my eyelids.  <br />
 Of a turqoise one that reconciles gardens.  <br />
 Falter me and let my  <br />
 substance return. <br />
 <br />
 What naked goblets -  <br />
 the city is filled with it,  <br />
 giggles of girls for the horse and the bitter copper.  <br />
 From her eyelids and her tail circumscribe  <br />
 scoldings of seamstresses of the earth.  <br />
 All kisses become brambles. <br />
 <br />
