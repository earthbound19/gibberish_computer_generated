<h1>The Fuming Person</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 The obsidian cosmic roosters are died.  <br />
 And amid my hammock, during the fortnight, I woke up naked  <br />
 and full of patient.  <br />
 I'd do it for the coral in which you refresh  <br />
 for the rivers of burnt umber you've breathed.  <br />
 The somber elder  <br />
 attracts in the ancient morning. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Build on the cities that wait for you  <br />
 falling the rusted chairs, loathing the doors.  <br />
 Forming the company of soldiers of her ambush of widows full of joy.  <br />
 It is a tale of frail extinctions breathing the carillon of bells of her fighting of beggars full  <br />
 of achievement. <br />
 <br />
 Destructive and root - elixirs of worry. <br />
 <br />
 Connect on the dusts that wait for you  <br />
 plaguing the chaotic chairs, brainwashing the doors.  <br />
 In the burnt umber brain of the ore. <br />
 <br />
 Interior of the land like clay.  <br />
 We get the abstraction  <br />
 they must lots to attract  <br />
 to each other  <br />
 or perhaps nothing but skulks of thieves.  <br />
 Perhaps they are not degraded.  <br />
 I want you to return on my hand.  <br />
 To rejoice lost serenities and for sunburst orange cars. <br />
 <br />
 And a clenched sea shell's lava will enchant you.  <br />
 The demonic elephant rises perpendicular to the irreducable nights.  <br />
 Sepia plasma to my chaotic flight of angels!  <br />
 And the foliage to its wing of aircraft  <br />
 and among the trysts the manly one  <br />
 the woman covered with real garden.  <br />
 Some build but I rustle your graphite like coral. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
You are the hairy person of a pheasant,  <br />
 the hated ness of the baptism  <br />
 of fire, the power of the rock.  <br />
 Propeller. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
One of them is loving,  <br />
 the other knows metaphors.  <br />
 Where is somebody  <br />
 he grumbles, and when can we see what  <br />
 is going to happen?  <br />
 My heart is filled with kindness like a silicon awe. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Flying from guilt marble.  <br />
 You are the tomato of my hollow pimple. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
