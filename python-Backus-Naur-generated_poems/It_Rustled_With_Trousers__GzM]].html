<h1>It Rustled With Trousers</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 A detail attracts,  <br />
 soddens - it does not return. Only demonic and to a  <br />
 bride they take on time, seven years  <br />
 negligent fortnight and the fragmented thought of barons  <br />
 pity at the walls of my house. <br />
 <br />
 Swim on the unctions of undertakers that wait for you  <br />
 penetrating the careless chairs, petrifying the doors.  <br />
 A arrogant inscription wipes  <br />
 even the comfortable  <br />
 overtone boulevard in language  <br />
 to which the metaphor  <br />
 will not be pulsed. <br />
 <br />
 Be guided by the affluent warmth's lighthouse.  <br />
 Carry me onto your car - the mango of my leaf -  <br />
 it's a rustling perfume of hounds. <br />
 <br />
 Brings all the harasses laminated signs.  <br />
 To seek another land shall we move on?  <br />
 The reasons for my respect  <br />
 are recovered in my toe of copper. <br />
 <br />
 I stayed attracted and blue  <br />
 betwixt the universe.  <br />
 It's a trusting path of skulks of thieves.  <br />
 It was a wounded business of parallel cummerbunds and jackals. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
With the cashmire brow of the rock.  <br />
 Which is a electric trouser of directions  <br />
 two or hundred, sought  <br />
 on a guild of beggars or in the lovely sweetnes  <br />
 directions of the ears, a calculation in your shoulders. <br />
 <br />
