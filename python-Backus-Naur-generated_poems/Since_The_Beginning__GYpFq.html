<h1>Since The Beginning</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 I salute your moonlit sugar  <br />
 and envy your slender pride. I saw how retinues of players are created  <br />
 by the cleansed pack of cards. I am forced by giggle of girls and seperation, by trash and sunshine. <br />
 <br />
 Halfway.  <br />
 I'd do it for the glaze of tourists in which you entertain  <br />
 for the starlights of green you've promised.  <br />
 Entertaining a poppy  <br />
 gathered in the perfect rain. <br />
