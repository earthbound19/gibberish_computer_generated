<p>
 A current of equinoctial goring of butchers  <br />
 that does not know why it flows and understands.  <br />
 My heart is filled with expectant like a chalk sea's skin. <br />
 <br />
 Return to the homeland of the castes of bread.  <br />
 In your heart of negative the boulevard of lights enrich. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Nobody here is waiting for the next prize.  <br />
 Autumn. You attracted yourself for seizing.  <br />
 Like the phosphorus foam of gardens the reasons for my respect  <br />
 are built in my toe of gem.  <br />
 Starry sky.  <br />
 With its sordid dedicate dictatorial and dew - benches of bishops of exhausted. <br />
