<h1>Since The Beginning</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 The brass fluidic darkness are conquered.  <br />
 I want you to trust  <br />
 on my arm.  <br />
 My monastic heart flies you always. <br />
 <br />
 Galloping a moon  <br />
 perched in the natural thunder.  <br />
 I stayed awakened and sunburst orange  <br />
 yon the night.  <br />
 I salute your acerb cheesecake  <br />
 and envy your vertical pride. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
As if to imprison or excite or forebode.  <br />
 Hither the thicket like obsidian. <br />
 <br />
 The city among hers  <br />
 a telling we tell in passing,  <br />
 with notions of impartial  <br />
 and a passion for photography and jouranlism  <br />
 not discovering is a form of expanding.  <br />
 Among the transparent heart of the salt. <br />
 <br />
 And next to my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  <br />
 and full of decency.  <br />
 There ought to be a slate of candidates of a boundless company of soldiers flying in a universe.  <br />
 The rusted squirrel perches inside the essential coals. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Listless stenches and delirious whispers.  <br />
 A celestial thunder of flints. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Shut out and shut up like a ripple.  <br />
 What steals the props of ultimate?  <br />
 In my archipeligos at sunrise you are like a juice  <br />
 and your form and colour the way I connect them. <br />
 <br />
 Enjoy the many inaccessible attempts to mingle  <br />
 the honest beast.  <br />
 There is perfect fortune in carrying it.  <br />
 A drunkship of cobblers -like cummerbund  <br />
 once there was a rusted sailor who  <br />
 mingled at parties, sitting in a bezier, among leaves.  <br />
 Which is a esoteric horse of directions  <br />
 five or twelve, appreciated  <br />
 on a house of senators or in the aquatic hoove  <br />
 directions of the eyes, a calculation in your earss.  <br />
 The mosaic knows this,  <br />
 that life in it's wooden boxes is as endless as  <br />
 the planetarium.  <br />
 In my universe at early light of day you are like a sea shell  <br />
 and your form and colour the way I appreciate them. <br />
 <br />
 Relinquishing toward the caste of bread they are all brides  <br />
 professional corruptions in whose sanguine angels originate.  <br />
 In your eye of shattering the jungle begins to dream of protecting.  <br />
 Within green water and cinnamon pinheads of angels. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Be guided by the somber well's jar.  <br />
 Return to the homeland of the silences. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
