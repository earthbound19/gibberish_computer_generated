<h1>The Devouring Of A Daughter Down A Moonlight Evening</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 On what chaotic coffins understood with aluminum? Betwixt the chaotic room of skeleton sun.  <br />
 What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  <br />
 It was a furious business of saliva and cummerbunds.  <br />
 A echo discovering will rustle  <br />
 the dilute gypsum of a planet. <br />
 <br />
 Brings all the erupts autumns.  <br />
 What is this calculation but a memory silenced of its trysts?  <br />
 Sometimes a piece of the brass  <br />
 mutates like a platoon of soldiers in my pimple. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
I am scratched by sea's skin and funeral, by enemy and sunshine.  <br />
 A faith of merchants trusting will relax  <br />
 the worn-out earth of a planet. <br />
 <br />
