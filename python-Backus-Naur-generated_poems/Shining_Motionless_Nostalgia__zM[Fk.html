<h1>Shining Motionless Nostalgia</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 All giggles of girls become bloodied obsidians.  <br />
 But I should be in line with oceanography, burying among its obscene troupes of artists  <br />
 so let us aspire to to divulge a story devoid of slightest redundancies. <br />
 <br />
 The guilt time is irreducable on your chest.  <br />
 Transparent mud to my sordid soul! <br />
 <br />
 <br />
A misunderstood study wets  <br />
 even the aquatic  <br />
 minor night in calculation  <br />
 to which the metaphor  <br />
 will not be perfumed.  <br />
 The lovely stranger  <br />
 awakens in the electric morning. <br />
