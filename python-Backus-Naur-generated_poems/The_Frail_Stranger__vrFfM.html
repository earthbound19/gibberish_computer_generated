<h1>The Frail Stranger</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 If I could rustle the billow of blood colored smoke and the modern office.  <br />
 I took on  <br />
 molested panels of experts.  <br />
 Everybody here is waiting for the next chorus of singers.  <br />
 Company of soldiers. You set yourself for weaving.  <br />
 The reasons for my respect  <br />
 are seized in my shoulder of wooden. <br />
 <br />
 Our new form, our sweet-smelling abominable sight of monks squares.  <br />
 The bruised promise is mineral on your eye.  <br />
 A raft is not enough to delude me and keep me  <br />
 from the sea of your indespensable funny things. <br />
 <br />
 It is a tale of careless salivas the cold toucan enchants betwixt the perfect  <br />
 corruptions.  <br />
 Your sun rise is a evening star filled with distorted host of angels.  <br />
 Nothing but your equinoctial finger.  <br />
 Among green water and opaque marine slates of candidates.  <br />
 From lap of cod to wrack of rabbits,  <br />
 hidden jars  <br />
 drawn by comfortable channels, a  <br />
 neon river bank begins to breathe. <br />
 <br />
 The shrapnel imposes nessecity.  <br />
 So the incredulous unruffled lives on in a tomato,  <br />
 the charitable house of the troupe of acrobats,  <br />
 the self-assured eddy that is charitable and noble.  <br />
 If I could gallop the abberation and the room. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
