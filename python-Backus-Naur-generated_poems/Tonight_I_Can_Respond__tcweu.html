<h1>Tonight I Can Respond</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 When you pacify like illusion of painters attracted by the heat.  <br />
 Halfway.  <br />
 To hear lost salts and for springtimes.  <br />
 Full stop. <br />
 <br />
 The maps exists even when there is  <br />
 little to say, and it ceases  <br />
 amid it in darkness.  <br />
 You say, what is the utensil waiting for in its crimson smooth stone?  <br />
 I tell you it is waiting for faucet like you.  <br />
 Legumes of a hairy wheel  <br />
 exciting inside the vicinity around a harsh boat,  <br />
 manly as a clenched tiger.  <br />
 Some discover but I dedicate your brick like faith of merchants. <br />
 <br />
 Tryst.  <br />
 I took on windy bells.  <br />
 So the wonderful powerful lives on in a banana,  <br />
 the velvety house of the alley of clowns,  <br />
 the domestic shoreline that is vertical and lyrical. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Fall me and let my substance understand.  <br />
 Nothing but your resplendent heart.  <br />
 Always you change through the early light of day  <br />
 toward the day falling splendors.  <br />
 You are the demonic pioneer of a jaguar,  <br />
 the shifty ness of the illusion of magicians, the power of the tin. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
