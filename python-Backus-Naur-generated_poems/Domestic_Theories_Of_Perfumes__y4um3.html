 There are no parallel uranuss but pale cycles of tiger and blue  <br />
 banners of affluent wet-winged aluminum.  <br />
 Always you replace through the sunrise  <br />
 toward the twilight drowning schools.  <br />
 You are the barbaous pioneer of a jaguar,  <br />
 the listless ness of the vein, the power of the plasma.  <br />
 Halfway. <br />
 <br />
 In the smallest cork magnolium only dead and to a  <br />
 man they take on time, few years  <br />
 shall we keep going?  <br />
 The reasons for my respect  <br />
 are carried in my loins of ceramic. <br />
