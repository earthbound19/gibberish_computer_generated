<h1>Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Setting In Projections</h1>

<p>
 The silt original imperfect paper-maches are changed. Multitude  <br />
 of waves!  <br />
 In and out of the opaque green the silvery and the green  <br />
 and you weave like a pack of cards and what flies the props of honor?  <br />
 A loop behind a circle,  <br />
 the shady workings of delicate law.  <br />
 You are the wayside astronaut of a elephant,  <br />
 the atrocious ness of the root, the power of the steel. <br />
 <br />
 You reflect  <br />
 my rotten bramble  <br />
 like a myriad iguana to fresh lemon.  <br />
 Among the pile of books of the area where you sleep,  <br />
 a dream shakes into studies.  <br />
 If I  <br />
 could love the funeral and the night.  <br />
 The disputation of lawyers imposes nessecity. <br />
 <br />
