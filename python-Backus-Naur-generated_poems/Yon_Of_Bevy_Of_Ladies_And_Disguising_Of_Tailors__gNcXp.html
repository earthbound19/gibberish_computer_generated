<h1>Yon Of Bevy Of Ladies And Disguising Of Tailors</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 I wish to make a square  <br />
 behind, and every faith, many  <br />
 times hidden in a squad of soldiers.  <br />
 Explosive utensils and muzzled utensils.  <br />
 I want you to tread on my eye. <br />
 <br />
 Shall we keep going?  <br />
 I'm the fisherman to the law of immediate damning of jurors.  <br />
 And the damning of jurors to its cluster of things  <br />
 and among the battalions of soldiers the manly one  <br />
 the child covered with honest batch of bread. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
The tin spacious coals are pitied.  <br />
 Transluscent blue silica to my fire-tipped queue of actors! <br />
 <br />
