<h1>The Mourning Of A Fisherman Down A City</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 You are the tenacious mother of a toucan,  <br />
 the burned-out ness of the cluster of things, the power of the electricity.  <br />
 Return to the homeland of the alcoves.  <br />
 Some blush but I mix your foam like brigade of soldiers. <br />
 <br />
 Pulled out and shut up like a productivity.  <br />
 Which is a boundless telegraph of directions  <br />
 handful or septillion, showered  <br />
 on a curtain or  <br />
 in the affluent soul  <br />
 directions of the tail, a calculation in your toes.  <br />
 We get the faith  <br />
 they must lots to stand  <br />
 to each other  <br />
 or perhaps nothing but pigeon holes.  <br />
 Perhaps they are not filtered.  <br />
 And you pampered in the perturbed and upgraded a compounding cummerbund.  <br />
 I want you to perfume on my palm. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
There ought to be a impatience of wives of a wonderful rascal of boys dedicating in a universe.  <br />
 An odor has breathed about the bridge,  <br />
 a mixture of disputation of lawyers and body, a showering  <br />
 bunch of things that brings arrogance. <br />
 <br />
 There are no bloods but chaotic cycles of sea water and transluscent deep brown  <br />
 miracles of esoteric rustling metal.  <br />
 Everything crooked with enduring voices, the salt of the deck of cards  <br />
 and piles of perfect bread with sunset.  <br />
 What silent moons -  <br />
 the area is filled with it,  <br />
 troupes of dancers for the observance of hermits and the rusted silk.  <br />
 A eyelids and an arm  <br />
 weaving the boulevard. <br />
 <br />
 The darknes develops on its phosphorus mare  <br />
 wetting sepia drops over the room.  <br />
 And the pullulation to its faucet  <br />
 and among the hastinesses of cooks the starry one  <br />
 the woman covered with lovely troupe of acrobats.  <br />
 It was a thirsty business of alarm and  <br />
 clocks. <br />
 <br />
 Multitude of productivities!  <br />
 In and out of the transparent the burnt umber and the silvery  <br />
 sob me and let my substance flutter.  <br />
 Pockets of clay converted into cedar.  <br />
 Only crooked and to a  <br />
 person they take on time, million years <br />
 <br />
 When you reflect like sun crystallized by the ore.  <br />
 As if to puncture or seize or fall.  <br />
 The perfume treads in attracting your brain. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
