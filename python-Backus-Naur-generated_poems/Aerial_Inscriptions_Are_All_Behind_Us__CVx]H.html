<h1>Aerial Inscriptions Are All Behind Us</h1>

<p>
 Here I am, a parsimonious tail smeared  <br />
 in the universe of bevy of beauties.  <br />
 What is  <br />
 this computer but a memory scratched of its branches? <br />
 <br />
 As if to smother or flutter or sodden.  <br />
 Weak morning and the windy bell  <br />
 devour at the walls of my house. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
A rigid study forces  <br />
 even the winged  <br />
 side area in camera  <br />
 to which the metaphor  <br />
 will not be loved.  <br />
 Wave of wave of obeisances of servants rolling down the sea. <br />
 <br />
