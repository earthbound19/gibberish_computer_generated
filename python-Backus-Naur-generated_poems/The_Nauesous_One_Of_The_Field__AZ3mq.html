<h1>The Nauesous One Of The Field</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 I  <br />
 am punctured by energy and belt, by convict and rain.  <br />
 A sunburst orange flock of tourists showers.  <br />
 We get the sense  <br />
 they must lots to perform  <br />
 to each other  <br />
 or perhaps nothing but lonely roads.  <br />
 Perhaps they are not soddened.  <br />
 A quadrangle among a circle, <br />
 <br />
 The banal workings of enchanting law. <br />
 <br />
 I'd do it for the wine bottle in which you refresh  <br />
 for the films of opaque opaque burnt umber you've crystallized.  <br />
 To circumscribe lost reams of paper and for platoons of soldiers.  <br />
 I'd do it for the illusion of magicians in which you circumscribe  <br />
 for the landscapes of green you've transformed.  <br />
 The reasons for my respect  <br />
 are appreciated in my brain of crystal. <br />
 <br />
 It's a storing nature of flames.  <br />
 To the domestic color of the chalk energy.  <br />
 A great mist of shuffles of bureaucrats. <br />
 <br />
 Intimidated and light - salts of waspish.  <br />
 A current of verdure impatience of wives  <br />
 that does not know why it flows and gallops.  <br />
 And a insatiable bridge's aluminum will relax you. <br />
 <br />
 There are no rotten stumps but forceful cycles of cluster and transparent  <br />
 changes of bells of ancient sterile ash.  <br />
 A directionless calculation undulates  <br />
 even the great  <br />
 historical sea in identity  <br />
 to which the metaphor  <br />
 will not be upgraded.  <br />
 One public option and wetting a tribe of natives  <br />
 loved in the nocturnal wind.  <br />
 It is a tale of muzzled wounded soldiers in your fingernails of rude the vicinity of stars crystallize.  <br />
 All guilds of beggars become wastelands. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
My heart moves from being thirsty to being enduring.  <br />
 Everything barbaous with indespensable voices, the salt of the armada of ships  <br />
 and piles of velvety bread within early light of day. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
