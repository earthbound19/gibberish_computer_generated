<h1>From Tin To Ore</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Nothing but your noble lip.  <br />
 It was a callous business of noise  <br />
 and quarrels of lawyers.  <br />
 The I in sneer of butlers flotilla of ships. <br />
 <br />
 In the face of so many unctions of undertakers to functionality.  <br />
 What phenomena does the pheasant contain?  <br />
 How little we magnify and how much it dawns the secrets of this universe.  <br />
 Return to the homeland of the phemonanas.  <br />
 In the fainting pins. <br />
 <br />
 The giggles of girls exists even when there is  <br />
 little to say, and it ceases  <br />
 inside it in shadow.  <br />
 I want you to drink on my breath.  <br />
 Worn-out holiday and the listless house of senators  <br />
 decay at the walls of my house.  <br />
 It performs like a huddle of players with the rascal of boys. <br />
 <br />
 Full stop.  <br />
 Cities of an absurd wheel  <br />
 rejoicing outside the room next to a bleak raft,  <br />
 balanced as a dead lobster.  <br />
 Nothing but that diamond architecture of sneers of butlers. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
How awakening is the decisive bloodied ash and it's acerb pities of prisoners?  <br />
 Among the listless archipeligos of distorted coat. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
If I could blossom the uranu and the modern office.  <br />
 Guilt sailors and aunts.  <br />
 For me they are grammatic. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
A train is not enough  <br />
 to ignore me and keep me  <br />
 from the modern office of your indespensable mysteries.  <br />
 My heart moves from being burned-out to being natural. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
