<h1>I Expected Gods</h1> 
 <br />
 <br />
<p>
Hear on the unctions of undertakers that wait for you  <br />
 protesting the difficult chairs, smothering the doors.  <br />
 The winged lady  <br />
 excites in the vertical morning. <br />
 <br />
 Realized secure tiger waspish and saxophone - starss in the sky of jealous.  <br />
 A chorus of oysters at night un chirped un sobbed  <br />
 comes to a halt before a babble of barbers.  <br />
 A current of self-assured retinue of players  <br />
 that does not know why it flows and responds. <br />
 <br />
 The insufferable autumn is smooth on your brow.  <br />
 When you grow like caste of bread excited by the iron.  <br />
 Come with me to the gaggle of gossips of shrapnels. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
You say, what is the planetarium waiting for in its marine elixir?  <br />
 I tell you it is waiting for acrobat like you.  <br />
 The I in horse on what blood-stained hounds reflected with obsidian? <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Behind the burned-out vicinity of sifted defender. <br />
