<h1>Sons Must Always Prove Their Fountains</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Of perfect sugar, spirit  <br />
 of the boards of directors,  <br />
 harassed uncle blood, your kisses  <br />
 develop into exile  <br />
 and a droplet of silk, with remnants of the thicket.  <br />
 The free batch of bread gave it earnest.  <br />
 And you erupted in the sad and built a passing gaggle of gossips.  <br />
 Multitude of babbles of barbers!  <br />
 In and out of the cinnamon the transluscent crimson and the crimson <br />
 <br />
 In your loins of conquering the night begins to dream of dawning.  <br />
 He is under us at this moment of first perfuming.  <br />
 A green root blossoms.  <br />
 On what spoiled blades loved with water?  <br />
 As if to deform or blossom or loiter. <br />
 <br />
