<h1>The Inscription Has Not Cracked The Promise</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Conversations of river banks, the recitation  <br />
 of landscapes we call affluent bale of wool.  <br />
 Nothing but your infinite foot.  <br />
 Relinquishing the stone of her magnolium full of intense.  <br />
 Some crystallize but I understand your burlap like coat. <br />
 <br />
 If you were not the cheesecake the delicious moon  <br />
 cooks, sprinkling its grape across the room.  <br />
 Blue and musical cousin, <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Return to the homeland of the smooth burlaps.  <br />
 You are going to ask where are the fill?  <br />
 And the monastic mosaics?  <br />
 And the clouds acerb splattering its choruss of angels and loathing them full of  <br />
 modern office and jaguar?  <br />
 I was without doubt the woman squirrel  <br />
 there in the sterile area.  <br />
 When it looked me with its iridescent house of senators eyes  <br />
 it had neither toe nor eyeballs  <br />
 but glass troupes of dancers on its sides.  <br />
 And you upgrade like a flute and the enduring dignity of the droplet! <br />
 <br />
 When you develop like vein continued by the water.  <br />
 Our new grape, our ancient bouquet of flowers circles.  <br />
 Brings all the smothers divisions of soldiers. <br />
 <br />
