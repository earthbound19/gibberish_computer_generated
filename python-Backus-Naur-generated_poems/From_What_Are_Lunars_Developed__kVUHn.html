<h1>From What Are Lunars Developed</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Conversations of stalkss of cattail, the recitation  <br />
 of saxophones we call humble fleet of ships.  <br />
 And you carry like a grace and it is  <br />
 a tale of rotten corruptions a snow of necklaces sun of a congealed  <br />
 banal bevy of girls.  <br />
 Volatile and stone - momenta of jealous. <br />
 <br />
 Everything pale with sanguine voices, the salt of the atom  <br />
 and piles of hidden bread within late afternoon.  <br />
 Inside blue water and cinnamon compendiums of books.  <br />
 The acerb tryst gave it insightful. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
On what ghostly wombs rustled with rock?  <br />
 A projection for phenomenon is the lack thereof. <br />
 <br />
 A line segment outside a quadrangle,  <br />
 the obscene workings of sweet-smelling law.  <br />
 Perfuming the shades of green of her affection full of faith. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  <br />
 blush of shuffles of bureaucrats and fleets of ships  <br />
 and the fleeting telegraphs of his native land?  <br />
 To seek another land the boulevard outside hers  <br />
 a rumor we tell in passing,  <br />
 with notions of focused  <br />
 and a passion for engineering and oceanography  <br />
 for a day, maybe billion,  <br />
 I rested under a grind of whales  <br />
 at a convenience store, waiting for the mountaineer to be next to.  <br />
 Nobody here is waiting for the next bottle.  <br />
 Company of actors. You transformed yourself for dawning. <br />
 <br />
 They are all strangers  <br />
 professional ghosts in whose enduring mists originate.  <br />
 Recovering the pencil of her peal of bells full of astounded.  <br />
 Draw from it the clenched  <br />
 production of its own metaphor. <br />
