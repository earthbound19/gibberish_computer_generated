<h1>I Have Gone Twisting</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 The phemonana faints, the armada of ships of celestial  <br />
 perches inside.  <br />
 Jovial is gone, the subject has sought. <br />
 <br />
 Around  <br />
 the night I like to wake like a disordered crew of sailors.  <br />
 Carry me onto your vessel - the orange of my company of soldiers -  <br />
 always you smear through the afternoon  <br />
 toward the sunrise shaking fleets of cars.  <br />
 Some dawn but I recover your brush like pencil. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
On what senile shadows upgraded with wind?  <br />
 Of your red team of players when you hold out your brain. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
