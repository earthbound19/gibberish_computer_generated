<h1>Tonight I Can Blossom</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 You, who is like a evil bird among the mingling of many woman.  <br />
 From escargatoire of snails to rain,  <br />
 hidden sea water drawn by aquatic channels, a  <br />
 sifted sphere begins to perfume. <br />
 <br />
 In the face of so many pigeon holes to positivity.  <br />
 A study loves,  <br />
 decays - it does not return. <br />
 <br />
 Has the heights been seized with curiosities?  <br />
 Among the propeller of the boulevard where you sleep,  <br />
 a dream drops into synonyms.  <br />
 Draw from it the directionless  <br />
 inscription of its own camera.  <br />
 The stranger smiles at the bride  <br />
 but the sailor does not smile  <br />
 when he looks at the jaguar man  <br />
 and the delirious ocean. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
