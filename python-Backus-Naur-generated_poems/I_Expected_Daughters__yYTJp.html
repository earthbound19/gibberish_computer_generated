<h1>I Expected Daughters</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 I do not force in the room of violenet cadaver.  <br />
 Pockets of broken glass converted into saphire. <br />
 <br />
 And goblets and utensils.  <br />
 You are the muzzled father of a jaguar,  <br />
 the harsh ness of the mirror, the power of the heat. <br />
 <br />
 It enchants like a crown outside the skein of wool.  <br />
 I wish to make a line  <br />
 next to, and every hearing, many  <br />
 times hidden in a lemon.  <br />
 The huddles of players exists even when there is  <br />
 little to say, and it ceases  <br />
 next to it in shadow. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
