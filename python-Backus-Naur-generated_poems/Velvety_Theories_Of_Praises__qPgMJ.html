<h1>Velvety Theories Of Praises</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 I hear  <br />
 as if outside a rambunctious battery of barracudas.  <br />
 Within the shattering acids. <br />
 <br />
 Not playing is a form of waking.  <br />
 Some imbue but I promise your brick like slate of candidates. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Preserved and then magnified in the university.  <br />
 Not the sand-colored moment  <br />
 when the sunrise flutters the keys.  <br />
 The cosmic dignity of the neverthriving of jugglers!  <br />
 The sneer of butlers chains, the school of clerks of hopeful  <br />
 kisses in front of. <br />
 <br />
 Magnifying the band of musicians of her compendium of books  <br />
 full of warm. <br />
 <br />
 Where carillons of bells  <br />
 meet  <br />
 flutes meet, in front of and behind and the sound  <br />
 of shrapnels, to reach out and perch in defensive.  <br />
 Morose batteries of barracudas and dry convicts. <br />
 <br />
