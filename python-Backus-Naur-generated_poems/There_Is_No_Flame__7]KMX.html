<h1>There Is No Flame</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Evening star was no longer below the transmission threshold.  <br />
 Parallel howlss of a boney ship  <br />
 perching amid the field within a neon airplane,  <br />
 thick as a rustling elephant.  <br />
 An odor has preserved behind the foam,  <br />
 a mixture of eternity and body, an appreciating  <br />
 fragrance of strawberry that brings scared.  <br />
 You are going to ask where are the fill?  <br />
 And the absent minded fightings of beggars?  <br />
 And the snow lion hearted splattering its gaggles of women and pitying them full of  <br />
 jungle and elephant? <br />
 <br />
 And the fold of chairs to its lemon  <br />
 and among the hearts the self-assured one  <br />
 the lady covered with cordial blast of hunters.  <br />
 The sweet-smelling daughter  <br />
 rustles in the honest morning.  <br />
 I could divulge nail, grave, and city  <br />
 from bottles and peals of bells  <br />
 with a ultraviolet hastiness of cooks  <br />
 with twisting lonely roads in my hips. <br />
 <br />
 You are going to ask where are the fill?  <br />
 And the rosy faiths of merchants?  <br />
 And the wind affluent splattering its farms and taunting them full of  <br />
 land and toucan?  <br />
 The explosive squirrel re-covers adjacent to the esoteric traps.  <br />
 I wish to make a line segment  <br />
 in, and every color, many  <br />
 times hidden in a propeller. <br />
 <br />
 Some entertain but I conduct your foam like warmth.  <br />
 Always you brainwash through the early light of day  <br />
 toward the late afternoon coagulating shadess of opaque opaque  <br />
 silvery.  <br />
 In my area at sunrise you are like a superfluity of nuns  <br />
 and your form and colour the way I blossom them. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Your ears entertains from west to north  <br />
 listless sunrise and the bruised crown  <br />
 pity at the walls of my house. <br />
 <br />
 He is in us at this moment of first conducting.  <br />
 For a day, maybe hundred,  <br />
 I rested under a shoal of sharks  <br />
 at a convenience store, waiting for the goddess to be next to. <br />
 <br />
