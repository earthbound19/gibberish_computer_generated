<h1>Song For The Mother Of Brutal Skeins Of Wool</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 Come with me to the lance of oblivions.  <br />
 It was a bleak business of bloodied ash and yeasts.  <br />
 And so that its cadavers will force your breath.  <br />
 Our new bell, our equinoctial batch of bread lines. <br />
 <br />
