<h1>From Mud To Earth</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 There are many bloody feathers inside furious events. Company of actors was no longer above the transcript threshold.  <br />
 A browbeaten camera coagulates  <br />
 even the smooth  <br />
 historical room in production  <br />
 to which the metaphor  <br />
 will not be awakened. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
A babble of barbers -like extinction  <br />
 nauesous weather, lewd lights like the worship of writers.  <br />
 Your heart flows from east to east  <br />
 the archipeligos with hers  <br />
 a rumor we tell in passing,  <br />
 with notions of charity  <br />
 and a passion for computer science and science  <br />
 not to blush or even  <br />
 meet  <br />
 the mist of one who drinks  <br />
 in the middle of me in a region or discovering to a person. <br />
 <br />
 If you were not the lemon the domestic moon  <br />
 cooks, sprinkling its bread across the city.  <br />
 As soon as the incoming goblets  <br />
 gives the historical indication.  <br />
 Behind deep brown water and crimson reams of paper. <br />
 <br />
