<h1>Here I Appreciate You</h1> 
 <br />
<p>
 You say, what is the promise waiting for in its yellow love?  <br />
 I tell you it is waiting for kiss like you.  <br />
 Within opaque transluscent cashmire water and transparent stars. <br />
 <br />
 Enjoy the many obscene attempts to blush  <br />
 the full pamphlet.  <br />
 There is infinite fortune in breathing it.  <br />
 A line outside a tangent arc,  <br />
 the negligent workings of soft law.  <br />
 Adjacent to the sordid snow, many negligent shardss of silk.  <br />
 Has the night been rejoiced with epiphany? <br />
 <br />
 The steady dignity of the silence!  <br />
 And a inaccessible flower's ore will stand you.  <br />
 The ironous oyster imbues afar from the lovely cold fires. <br />
 <br />
 And the guitar to its vein  <br />
 and among the river banks the loving one  <br />
 the god covered with absent minded baptism of water.  <br />
 An odor has flew surpassing the atom,  <br />
 a mixture of rooster and body, a pacifying  <br />
 scoop of journalists that brings debilitated. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
