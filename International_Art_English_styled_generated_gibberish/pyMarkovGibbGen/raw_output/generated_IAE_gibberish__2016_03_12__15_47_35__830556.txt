natural elements and energy.

For the Mesa Arts Center, my work and bequeathed it to be learned has not been registered or quantified. These new museums seem to have UBS as main sponsor for the granting of statehood to synthetic subcultural milieux which for some reason, it didn't have that slam effect that the task of the delicious – of abiding friendships and fertile reveries - must come with different scales, speeds, rhythms and shapes. On a good chance much of the immediacy of today through subtle and inspiring wilderness in less well-known areas of interest arise and lead to white fur, ice-blue eyes and the North American Print Biennial. I exhibited several multi-paneled works that are being built today than at any other hue. Colour is chosen intuitively by weight and by seeing present commitments in a global Pax Americana in traditional geopolitical terms, when in fact in the zip-lock bags.
