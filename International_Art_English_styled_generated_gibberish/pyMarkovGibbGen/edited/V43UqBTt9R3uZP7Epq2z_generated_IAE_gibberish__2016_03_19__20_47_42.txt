Via ideas, images and memories of living for four months in a certain relation of two contrasting colours, the contrast of Light Red and one that yields its secrets only in our present age of the picture, the discursive logos of modern thought as represented in the design and perceptual system led me to this introspective yet extraspective distillation of my feelings. But although this generally produces calm, it remains that sometimes we glimpse proof of the canvas support as pictorial ground, conveyed specifically by the demonic in the exhibition space, the simulation of that which is Not.
