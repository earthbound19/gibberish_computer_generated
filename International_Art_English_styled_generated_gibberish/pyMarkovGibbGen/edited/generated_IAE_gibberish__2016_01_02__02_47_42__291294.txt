In this work, sponsored by the National Foundation for the work of Krasner and Lewis, all materials are balanced on a screen, and a miniature robot that detects and follows the movement of the arts. Although silence as a conversation between Swain and the Greater Economy as an extension of the photographic, it institutes this work selected by Bergen Kunsthall.

Curated by John Held, Jr. and Tim Russell, co-curated by Samantha Hardingham and Hans Ulrich Obrist, Bige Örer, director of the everyday versus more universal dynamics of our time.
