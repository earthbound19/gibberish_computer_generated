My work considers the pull of beauty, cliché, comfort and abuse. Much of this was inspired by my time at the theatre of confessions at the Cave and Basin Hot Springs in winter, where over 600 internees occupied the Castle Mountain/Banff camp between 1915 and 1917. They explored the animal kingdom, often inverting its laws and collapsing the boundaries of living beings and inanimate symbols of cultural change where new technologies build upon the relative hierarchical relationships of the painting processes of that time.
