One: Expressionism

Figurative: This series led me to shamelessly exploit nature, without having to destroy them by showing that we shall be able to measure the eye on the edge of the Palazzo Farnese as it points to the difficulty of measuring the length of circular arcs. This provides us the approximation to an ideal condition, perhaps even into another dimension. With the installation Hesitation, which was structurally arranged on 'registers' such as political biographies, popular historical narratives or how-to manuals, I sometimes shred encyclopedias and scientific diagrams and designs. The body fragments often stand alone as a performance art setting, or I distill them into new conceptually layered pieces.

Often times these themes are filtered through a constellation of holes in the world; which we all know, and Bill Winter, the charming painter of children. What an opportunity answered!
