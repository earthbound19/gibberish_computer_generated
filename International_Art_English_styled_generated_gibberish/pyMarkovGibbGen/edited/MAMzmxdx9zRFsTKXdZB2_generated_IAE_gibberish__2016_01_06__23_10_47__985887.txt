My work touches common development in solidary with stone and depiction of the shapefulness of the same. Stone circles are on their way, to talk about these relationships.

I'd like to invite artists to love all art forms as long as the Z' axis (if X is width and Y is height then Z is depth, the diagonal), having painted without referential images for my artist statement--so I am not so interested in developing the form and content of the human figure-- may bring to an awareness the artist collective Painting Disorders.
