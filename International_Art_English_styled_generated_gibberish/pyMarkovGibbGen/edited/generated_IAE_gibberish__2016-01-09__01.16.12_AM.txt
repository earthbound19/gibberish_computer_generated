When I arrived in Canada in the early 80s, the war in El Salvador was all over the news, and I became aware that painting should be a technical process dancing around the tacit, formalist belief that visible phenomena are a structure of the brain. But they are about the past, smeared with a patina of the present, trying to overturn our position as a response to Western society’s seemingly unquestionable belief in a rational universe. As well to say we understand everything as that skeletons battle soldiers in murky swamps; towers of eyeballs goggle cartoonishly; flesh peels wetly off bare bones. The list is endless. Where Ziółkowski’s measured and often peckishly painterly style features a white van traveling, forwardly mobile structuring inherent in the process, it points to stereotypes of different histories of fragments which are interwoven and embossed into the paper, etc.--so that errors are not repeated. Errors are frighteningly more expensive than gold. Platinum prints are not only transfers, but embodiments of their technical and scientific diagrams and designs. The body politic as a sentient character. The removal of dictators has only peeled back then, without the possibility of in fact being able to paint even with unconventional truth which resides on the surfaces, to reveal colour--will this enable us to depict the scene in the fullness of pure representational capability? Or will they merely bunniesring to us fragments of art art collections, art history?
