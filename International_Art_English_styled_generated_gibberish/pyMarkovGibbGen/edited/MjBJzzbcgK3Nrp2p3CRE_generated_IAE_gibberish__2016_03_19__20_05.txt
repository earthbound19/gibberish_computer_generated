In my works' growing role in uprisings and conflicts, it becomes as much a part of their spectacle as its medium. 

The exhibition of this work at Kunstraum Kreuzberg/Bethanien is the culmination of a year-long series of events and online publications. Through a variety of artworks by artists of different generations, as well as through a plethora of musical, literary, journalistic and cinematic documents, the exhibition presents diverse and at times contradictory forms of spectatorship in relation to political events. It explores the role played by spectators, questioning their agency and interest concerning circumstances that they do not experience directly, and asking how might they be implicated within this peculiar long-distance relationship. If mediation is inherent to the contemporary political sphere, how does this forge perceptions and reactions? Is spectatorship intrinsically voyeuristic, or conversely, does it carry emancipatory potential? How might the observer contribute to the construction of historical narratives?
