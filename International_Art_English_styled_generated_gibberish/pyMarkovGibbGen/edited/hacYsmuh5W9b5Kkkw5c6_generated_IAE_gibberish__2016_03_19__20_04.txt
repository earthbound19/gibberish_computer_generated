What is art narrative? Is it the act of viewing individual and solipsistic works, and might it also effect or help constitute a collectivity?

Gathering questions concerning the ambivalent way in which the role of technological mediation is perceived within the political sphere, art narrative problematizes the notions of distance in relation to involvement, spectatorship in relation to engagement, and vision in relation to action.

The very process of art exhibition proposes a stage for a self-reflexive gesture: "we--" who observe other onlookers by way of a
lens, screen or canvas--become spectators ourselves.

This process may involve gathering of solicited essays and archival material by a wide range of intellectuals or lowly poseurs, forming a growing collection of cultural hubbub, twaddle, twitter, prattle, idle talk, water cooler talk, chatter, fiddle-faddle, hifalutin prognostications, and cognitive processing mistressizing.
