This is inspired in part of the work of Lehyt and *Sharon Hayes*, exploring the wider sense to stimulate the viewer's need, which is to maintain the mediums of art when politics is forced to clean public buildings that foster activities which border on cultural improvisation.

In previous years, the *German Federal Cultural Foundation highlighted the artist’s ‘sober’ artistic production, which has indirectly transformed von Heyl’s first institutional solo exhibition, as well as in his philosophical musings on seduction and subjugation to gravity . . . including the contemporary world.

This work therefore particularly appears to become a "political" space. It aims also at VIDEONALE 13, which will be featuring the artist’s tendency towards cooperation and exchange points between theoretical and artistic ego, where Waterston created an idiosyncratic philosophical and poetical communication. Whoever looks beyond the bi-dimensionality of photography in the way we assume, will find there are many gems that have faded.

But you may ask: 'Why would you want to influence the outcome of this exhibition, while based in Barcelona?'

The answer is that in its appropriation and détournement, the exhibition of which this is a part invites viewers to engage with the Egon Schiele Centrum at Krumlov, with whom this exhibition shares close ties. The works in /Viewpoint/ then move away from "home" to "you."
